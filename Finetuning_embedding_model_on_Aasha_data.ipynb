', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_5': 'What is this Book about?\\nYou have chosen to be an ASHA. You have been selected by your community \\nto serve as a resource because you understand their needs, their beliefs and \\npractices, the social factors, where the poor and needy live, and what people \\nwant from health services. You already know a lot about the community in which you live. However in order to be an effective resource, you need \\nadditional knowledge and skills. You need to learn about health rights and \\nentitlements, the causes and treatment of common illnesses, and type of treatment available at different facilities. You need to develop the skills to \\ncommunicate health related information to people in the community, to \\ncounsel them on prevention of illness and to adopt healthy behaviours, to treat minor ailments and the leadership ability to help people negotiate access to \\nrights and entitlements. \\nThis book is the first in a series of books that will help you do this. As a new \\nentrant to the ASHA programme, this book provides you with a basic level of \\nknowledge and skills to enable you to start your work. After you have grasped \\nthe contents of this book and have applied your new knowledge in your community, additional rounds of trainings will follow, in which you will not only \\nlearn many new things but also get more information on topics that you will \\nlearn in this book. Your community is also an important source of knowledge. Use the knowledge and skills that you get from your books, to build on your \\nlearning from the community, so that you can offer help to the people. That \\nis why your training is conducted for a short duration and allows you time to practice your new skills in the community. After this training, you will be \\nassessed and get a basic certification in communication and social mobilisation. \\nThe next level of certification is after four rounds of training and this will enable you to address issues in care of mothers, newborns and children. As your skill \\nlevel improves, additional certification will be available.

Your role is three-fold: to be \\na facilitator of health services and link people to health care facilities, to \\nbe a provider of community level health care, and an activist, who builds people’s understanding of health rights and enables them to access their entitlements.

Home visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or five days \\na week, you should visit the families living in your community. If it is a large \\nvillage, then you will have a certain number of allocated households. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, \\nfamilies will come to you when there is a problem and you will not have to \\ngo so often to their houses. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, you should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the \\nhouse, a series of seven visits or more becomes essential.\\n2. Attending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide \\nantenatal care, immunisation and other services in the village, you, as the ASHA will promote attendance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM \\nservices and help with service delivery.\\n3.

', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_11': '11 Induction Training Module for ASHAsValues of an ASHA\\nHere are some important values which should guide you in your work: \\nBe kind:  Have compassion for people and never be afraid to show that you \\ncare. Be especially kind to those who are sick, it is more important than a \\nmedicine. Try not to refuse your services to any individual who really needs them. \\nTreat everybody equally:  Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or \\nhis class, caste, sex and religion. As a health worker your concern is well being of \\nall the individuals not just those you know well or who come to you or who are \\nthe better off and powerful. Inequalities in our society deprive many sections \\nof community from health care services. These are the marginalised people and include those who come from extremely poor families, live in inaccessible or \\ndistant part of our villages, belong to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe families, \\nhave only women in their households and are disabled or handicapped. Treating everybody equally also means spending more time and effort on those \\nwhose needs are more.\\nBe responsible: Be responsible to your designated duties and never misuse \\nyour authority for your benefit or for the benefit of friends and relatives \\nRespect people’s traditions and ideas:  People are slow to change their \\nattitudes and traditions and are true to what they feel is right. Rather than \\ninsisting that they adopt your approach, you must try to build on their existing \\nknowledge with your ideas. For example-you can promote the use of modern \\nmedicine together with the traditional methods and the combination may serve better than either one alone. Thus, you can promote the use of ORS for \\ntreating a child with diarrhoea but at the same time encourage mothers to use \\ntraditional preparation like rice water, coconut water to overcome dehydration.\\nKeep learning: Use every chance you get to increase your own knowledge \\neither through reading books, or attending training programmes or asking \\nquestions. \\nBe a role model:  If you want people to take part in improving their village and \\ncare for their health, you must be a role model and practise healthy habits and \\nbehaviours. This way you will earn people’s trust and confidence.

If you \\nlist the common health or other associated problems for your village, it may \\nlook similar to the one depicted below:\\nMalnutrition\\nProblems related to pregnancy, lack of skilled \\ncare during delivery and lack of prompt care \\nfor complications leading to Maternal deaths\\nUnsafe drinking water\\nImproper sanitation and \\nunclean surroundings\\nOther problems affecting the health of individuals - \\npoverty, alcohol abuse, early age of marriage, etc.Common childhood illnesses like \\npneumonia, diarrhoea causing infant \\ndeaths & malnutrition\\nInfectious diseases like, malaria or \\nTuberculosis', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_20': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 20What are the Factors that Contribute to Good \\nHealth?\\nHealthy environment and hygienic habits\\nOur surroundings and personal hygiene have a direct impact on our \\nhealth. Clean living environment and proper hygienic conditions ensure \\ngood health. The place we live, the food we eat, our drinking water and \\nthe air we breathe - needs to be free of pollutants, harmful chemicals and disease causing germs. This will prevent spread of many illnesses \\nlike respiratory infections, diarrhoea, breathing problems etc. \\nSocio cultural factors\\nBoth social and economic inequality and deprivation have an \\nadverse effect on health. Thus poorer households, families from more \\nmarginalised communities with poor education and those in more \\nhealth risk prone occupations are more likely to have malnutrition, illness and deaths. Social beliefs and cultural practices also have a \\nstrong link with the health of an individual. For example, Neglect of \\ngirl child leads to compromised health status of women.\\nLife style\\nLife style consists of health behaviours and practices that affect the health of individuals. Lifestyles that have a positive influence are \\nregular exercise, a nutritious well balanced diet, etc. Some forms of life \\nstyles may be detrimental to health. These are: Alcohol/drug abuse/tobacco chewing/smoking etc. \\nGenetic factors (Heredity)\\nGenetic make-up is what we inherit from our parents. It plays a role in determining our physical structure, appearance (body-frame, height, \\nweight, looks, colour of our skin) and also some mental and emotional \\ntraits of our personality. It is important for you to know that some diseases are also linked to hereditary factors. They include high blood \\nsugar, high blood pressure etc. \\nAvailability of and access to appropriate health services\\nFor individuals to remain healthy it is important that health services \\nare available, accessible and affordable. As a community health worker \\nyour role is not only to promote healthy life practices but also in \\nfacilitating and organising community’s access to health services and treatment for illnesses.There are several levels at which health services \\nare provided by the health system and you will learn about this later \\nin the module. \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_21': '21 Induction Training Module for ASHAsAn “Activist” is person who actively leads her/his community for a \\nparticular cause. Before we discuss your role in detail, you should read the \\nreal life examples of activism in Annexure 4.\\nAs an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist primarily to reduce \\ninequities and improve the access of marginalised and disadvantaged to \\npublic health care services. To do this you should work “along” with them and \\nnot “for” them, and make them understand their health needs, rights and subsequently avail services. Mobilising the community takes time and is energy \\nconsuming. As you mature in your work, with continuous training and support, \\nyou will gradually learn to mobilise your community for accessing their health rights. In the meanwhile, try not to lose patience and hope.\\n“In the broadest sense, a community activist is one who works for \\nsocial change in the community.” \\nUnderstanding Fundamental Rights\\nYou will often find that people are not aware of their rights and face prejudices. Thus, knowledge about fundamental rights is important for every individual \\nincluding you, the ASHA.

As an ASHA, it is most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. \\nSkills of an ASHASection 4', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_30': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 30For participatory leadership you need to\\nl Establish goals and set the direction: First articulate an achievable goal for \\nyour village. Involve your community through local institutions especially the \\nvillage health sanitation and nutrition committee on how, where and when \\nit would be completed. For example, all children of your village should be immunised in the next six months. \\nl Set high standards and high expectations: Be firm \\nabout ensuring high quality health care services from \\nthe sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. \\nEg. Make sure that the ANM reaches the village on the designated VHND, with the requisite equipment \\nand drugs (weighing scales, BP apparatus, disposable \\nsyringes for immunisation, ice box for vaccines) and drugs and provides the package of services for \\nmothers and children. If the health service provider treats a community member with disrespect or does not provide the services or does not pay \\nattention to quality, you should feel able to ask her to change behaviour or \\npractice.\\nl Be accountable and responsible: to the community and the health care provider by being an effective link and sharing information. But being \\nconstantly critical of the situation will have no positive outcome. Address the \\nissue by sharing your grievances with authorities who can take action. For example, if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting \\nthe houses of socially backward families, have the courage to tell her that you \\nhave noted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. Enlist the help of VHSNC, Sarpanch, Block Medical Health Officer or Chief \\nMedical Health Officer and ensure that the ANM visits your village regularly.\\nl Involve others in decision-making: Do not make any decisions alone. A \\ndecision, which affects the community, needs to be taken along with the community members, with their complete ownership. For example, better \\nresults are attained if priorities and decisions regarding community health needs are taken as part of collectives such as the VHSNC. \\nl Motivate others: By involving the Panchayat, SHG members and VHSNC \\nthrough regular contact, sharing necessary information, giving them \\nresponsibility and acknowledging their support and efforts in public. \\nInvite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care. Involve community members in the process when availing for them \\ntheir entitlements from the public health system or by giving them some \\nresponsibility to improve the health status of the community. ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_31': '31 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Achieve unity: As a leader you need to promote unity among your \\ncommunity members and between the community members and health \\ncare providers. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership \\nfor their health and see that they also have a role in achieving the goal.\\nl Serve as a role models: Always set an example that can be followed. For \\nexample, you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman \\nfor a referral. If you performed this role and saved the life of woman in your \\nvillage, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman \\nduring an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if \\nrequired. You should constantly improve your knowledge and skills and try to \\nbe aware of any new developments regarding the health services and new \\nschemes declared primarily by being in touch with the ANM. Improve your \\nskills by practising them.\\nl Represent the community: Make sure you represent the entire community \\n(including the marginalised sections) while discussing their health concerns \\nwith the health service provider. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and VHSNC. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of \\nthe poor of your community. If some segment of the community has shared \\nthat the source of drinking water is not accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion while developing a comprehensive health plan for the \\nvillage. \\nCommunication Skills\\nCommunication is the exchange or \\ntwo-way flow of information and ideas \\nbetween two or more persons. People \\nwho do not communicate well, create confusion, frustration and problems. Your \\ncommunication skills will enable you to \\ncounsel women and families on health promotion, adopting healthier practices \\nand mobilising them to avail services at health institutions. They also help you \\nestablish rapport with the stakeholders and other health functionaries.There are three different forms of communication - verbal; non-verbal and written. \\nEach of these is useful for you. \\nl Verbal communication: This is the most common way of communicating, \\nbut should be done in a way that the person or persons to whom you are \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_32': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 32communicating the message has understood it. So you must deliver it in \\na way that the person understands what you are saying. To know if your \\nmessage was received properly, get feedback from the person whether she/\\nhe understood the message. One-way communication is when only you talk \\nand the other has not understood. This is incomplete and ineffective.\\nEffective Verbal Communication has Accuracy;  \\nClarity and Correctness. \\nl Non-Verbal Communication: We all know that communication is not only \\nabout words and languages. Silence also communicates, and there are \\ngestures that people make with their hands, body and eyes. These forms \\nof communication are referred to as non-verbal communication. Here are some non-verbal forms of communication:\\nl Eye contact: with the person to whom you are talking will indicate your sincerity and confidence. \\nl Body posture: Facing the person, standing or sitting appropriately close and holding your head erect gives value or weight to your messages\\nl Facial expressions: Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions therefore express appropriate feelings on your face\\nl Gestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. \\nl Written Communication: As an ASHA you will need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You \\nalso need to document the processes and decisions taken during meetings. \\nYou will thus have to learn to write simply and effectively. (In Annexure 6, \\nthere is an exercise for you on writing). Even if you take the help of others in \\nthe community, you should remember the following important points: \\nl Address it to the appropriate person \\nl Check that the letter has a date and topic \\nl Keep sentences short and avoid unnecessary words\\nl Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones \\nl Explain facts through evidence and examples \\nActive listening is also part of communication\\nHearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening \\ninvolves the reception and interpretation of what is heard. Active listening \\ninvolves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_33': '33 Induction Training Module for ASHAsdirections, understand others, solve problems, share interests, and see how the \\nother person feels, or even show support. This type of listening takes the same \\namount of, or more, energy than speaking. It requires the listener to hear various \\nmessages, understand the meaning and then verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. \\nFor good listening: Encourage individuals to talk by using positive gestures \\nand words, remove distractions and try to understand non-verbal signals. Do not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking. Reflect \\non the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard. This will enable \\nestablishing a good rapport with the community.\\nCommunicating with stakeholders- Keep in mind the following points \\nwhile talking to stakeholders and health functionaries- \\nl Give due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. \\nl While sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence.\\nl Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you \\nwant to continue.\\nl Be calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety and do not \\nuse a blaming tone.\\nYou will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those \\naround you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your \\nmessage through.\\nPoints to take care of while communicating:\\nl When you visit families, greet the individuals and explain the reason of your \\nvisit.\\nl Maintain eye contact with the person to whom you are talking, act with confidence but speak in a gentle tone which is loud enough to be heard and \\nalways be respectful\\nl Stick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time and use \\nsimple words in local language. Do not use technical words or jargon. Your \\npronunciation should be clear.\\nl Be specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating. \\nl Be empathetic and try to share the feelings of individuals.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_34': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 34l Be open-minded. This will help you understand the other person’s point of \\nview. In case of talking to your beneficiary check if she has any question and \\nanswer in simple language\\nl Acknowledge the efforts made by the beneficiaries and never forget to \\ncompliment/appreciate them.\\nNote: In health communication, while counselling individuals you need to actively listen to what is being said, analyse all the factors and then dialogue with the person so that, together, the right choices are made. Counselling involves problem \\nsolving and not merely preaching to adopt correct practices. \\nDecision Making Skills\\nEach decision has a consequence and even a small \\ndecision can change many things. All of us can recall \\nsome such decisions taken personally or by others \\nwhich have left an important impact. As an ASHA you will be often required to take decisions, that will affect \\nthe community at large. Hence, you should learn the \\nskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. \\nSome basic steps of decision-making are: \\nl Define the Problem: Examine the situation carefully \\nand analyse it from all perspectives to find out the \\nactual problem. \\nl Gather Information and share with the community: As a next step collect \\nall the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Take information on what exists, what does not \\nexists and what needs to be there. At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meeting and discuss the situation to help them \\nbecome part of the solution. \\nl Think of possible solutions: You should work with the VHSNC and even the \\nGram Sabha if needed on identifying solutions. At this stage many solutions will be offered. It shows that people accept and understand the problem, and \\nare interested in identifying solutions.\\nl Choose one solution by consensus: Part of effective decision-making is \\nthe ability to select one alternative from the various options available. This \\ncan be done through consensus of the community and approval of the \\nauthorities. To gain consensus and approval you need to discuss this in the VHSNC meetings and the Gram Sabha. Before selecting the right alternative, \\nassess all available options. ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_35': '35 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Put the Decisions to Work: An effective decision is one which can be put \\ninto action. Thus, implementation is very important. During this process, \\nkeep checking if it is moving towards the expected solution, and if there is \\nsomething else which needs to be addressed. An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling \\namong group members after the meeting \\nhas been a djourned. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature \\namong persons or groups.\\nDecision-making skills are sharpened through experience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. \\nHow to handle difficult situations\\nIf you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and \\nreview the options. It may be a good idea to adjourn and let people think about \\nit overnight. \\nNegotiation Skills\\nNegotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. As \\nan ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these \\ndifferences to achieve the larger goals of village health programmes. You will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to \\nfulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to \\nnegotiate with people in authority but with enough preparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situation which requires negotiation. \\nThe steps of Successful Negotiation\\nl Ask for the other person’s perspective: In a negotiating situation use \\nquestions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. \\nSome examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? \\nWhat are your concerns about what I am suggesting/asking? When you hear \\nthe other person express their needs or concerns, use appropriate listening \\nresponses to make sure you heard correctly. \\nl State Y our needs: In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but \\nalso why you need it. \\nl Prepare options beforehand: Before entering into a negotiation, prepare \\nsome options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not \\nacceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and \\nbe prepared to counter the same with an alternative. ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_36': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 36l Do not argue: Negotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about \\ntrying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation \\nwhen each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. \\nIf you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a power struggle. \\nl Consider timing: There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on \\neither side, a preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or \\ntiredness on one side or the other. \\nSuggestions for effective negotiation \\nWhile negotiating as an ASHA you must be patient. Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to \\nunderstand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not \\nbegin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. \\nApproach a negotiation with an attitude of,  “I accept you as an equal \\nnegotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ \\nYou may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. \\nHow to use your negotiation skills effectively?\\nIn your community you may come across several issues that require to be \\naddressed. For example, VHND does not take place, the Anganwadi is not \\nfunctioning well; children and women are not receiving their entitlement of \\nsupplementary food; the midday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly; widow pension is not being received despite completion of \\nformalities etc. \\nl To change such situations first try to find out if things can be changed \\nby drawing the attention of people like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the \\nschoolteacher, AWW through direct dialogue.\\nl If the situation still does not improve, try to organise people and facilitate \\ngroup discussions over the issue. The VHSNC meeting is a good forum to \\naddress such issues.\\nl If this also does not work, try to identify organisations working on the same \\nissue and seek their support.

This \\nsection will help you understand in detail the role of food and hygiene in \\nmaintaining good health.\\nRole of Diet and Food in Maintaining Good Health\\nWe all know that we need food to give us energy, live and grow. Our \\nregular requirement of food depends on the stage of our life and the \\namount of work we do. To grow better we need sufficient amounts of \\nfood rich in all essential elements. \\nA newborn needs only mother’s milk till six months of age and needs \\nit frequently. After six months the child needs complementary feeding \\nand can gradually learn to eat all that adults eat, though it should be given in smaller amounts and more frequently. \\nFood requirements of a pregnant mother are higher than other women.\\nThe important qualities of our food are related to the nutrition it \\nprovides, its quantity and frequency.\\nWhat constitutes good food? \\nMajor constituents of the balanced diet and their functions are:\\nl Proteins: Important for body growth and strength. Milk, Pulses and beans are plant sources and animal sources include eggs, poultry \\nproducts, all kinds of meat products and fish.\\nl Carbohydrates*: Form the bulk of our food and the main source \\nof our daily energy needs. This we get mainly from cereals like, rice, \\nwheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra. Tubers like potato also provide \\ncarbohydrates.\\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_42': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 42l Fat (from oils and ghee) – Provide extra energy, \\nand are good especially for children, as they give \\nmore energy as compared to cereals. Fat cells \\nstored in our body also act as an insulation to protect it from heat and cold. They also help in \\nabsorption of certain Vitamins like A and D. Fats \\nare derived from sources like oil, butter, ghee,  nuts etc.\\nl Vitamins and Minerals – They are essential nutrients required in small quantities and help \\nfight diseases. Present in vegetables, fruits, \\nsprouts. Calcium, iron, iodine and zinc are some key minerals required by body. \\nl Fibres or roughage and plenty of water –  Are also essential for a healthy body \\n* (Traditionally communities used to eat more coarse cereals like sorghum (called Jowaar), maize, ragi, and bajra. Wheat and Rice became popular in our country \\nonly in recent decades. The traditional cereals are richer \\nin nutritional value and were more easily available to all sections of society as they were grown easily and were \\ncheap. All cereals when eaten in less polished form, retain \\nmore nutritional value.)\\nGood Dietary Practices –These include eating a \\nbalanced diet which is full of all essential components \\nof food in right proportions. Frequency of meals is also an important aspect. Children and Pregnant \\nWomen should have more meals. Having a balanced \\nmix of different food items like cereals, pulses, green vegetables and fruits is good for our health. \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_43': '43 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Role of Personal Hygiene and Clean Surroundings in \\nkeeping Good Health\\nPersonal Hygiene and cleanliness are not only essential to a good quality of life, \\nthey are also closely related to maintaining good health and preventing disease. \\n“Gandhi Ji said that Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” \\nMany infections spread either through unhygienic surroundings or poor \\npersonal hygiene.\\nFaeces\\nFlies\\nFood\\nMouthWater Hands\\nThe illustration above shows the many ways in which the disease causing \\norganisms spread from human faeces into the food we eat and the water \\nwe drink.

', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_44': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 44l Hand washing can be done with ash, but for this ash must be fresh from the \\nfire. Because it is difficult to ensure that the ash we are using is fresh and \\nuncontaminated, its use must be discouraged.\\nl For hand washing to be effective it must be done properly and all 6 steps of \\nhand washing must be followed every time. Refer Annexure 8 for details.\\nl Hand washing will not be effective, as long as our nails are not cut. Spaces between the nails and fingers collect dirt. \\nThe two practices of using clean toilets and hand washing, together can stop the spread of many communicable diseases to a large extent.\\nii) Maintaing hygiene of other body parts\\nl Skin: Cleanliness of skin is essential for overall body hygiene and is particularly important in a hot country like ours. A daily bath with soap and \\nwater and thorough cleaning of hands, feet and face helps in removing \\nsweat and accumulated dirt. Dirt makes the body a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. Wearing clean, dry clothes and footwear help us remain \\nclean and keep away many skin infections. A daily change of clothes, \\nparticularly undergarments, is a good practice. \\nl Teeth and gums-Teeth should be brushed regularly at least twice every day, using a soft bristled brush. Brushing removes food particles accumulated \\nbetween our teeth and prevents the growth of bacteria which cause cavities \\nand gum disease. \\nl Hair: Keeping hair clean by regular wash with a mild shampoo/soap is important to avoid infections and infestation by head lice.\\nB) Measures pertaining to our surrounding\\ni) Using clean toilets\\nThe practice of open defecation is common in our rural areas as well as in many \\nof the urban pockets. Due to this, harmful organisms contaminate the soil and \\nwater sources. Use of sanitary toilets by all will stop this faecal contamination. As an ASHA you should work with the VHSNC in ensuring that all households have \\naccess to sanitary toilets and use them regularly. There are many government \\nschemes that provide support for construction of toilets. \\nii) Safe handling of food and water\\nSafe handling of food and water also prevents many diseases. This can be achieved \\nthrough:  \\nl Cleaning of the food items before cooking or consuming.\\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_45': \"45 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l Keeping the food covered, away from dirt and flies.\\nl Avoiding consumption of partially cooked meat, eggs and unboiled milk.\\nl Using clean utensils for storing, cooking and consuming food. \\nl Drinking water from clean water source.\\nl Storing water in clean, covered pots.\\nl Using a long handle ladle or a utensil with a tap to take out water to prevent \\ncontamination. Benefits of clean water source like hand pumps are often \\nlost when the water is not handled properly.\\niii) Sanitary disposal of solid and liquid waste \\nAccumulated solid and liquid waste is a breeding ground for many disease causing organisms. This should be checked through:\\nl Preventing collection of solid waste in the surroundings- Decaying \\nsolid waste is a breeding ground for many vectors like housefly, rats, kala-\\nazar etc. Support of VHSNC should be taken for arranging regular disposal \\nof solid waste. You should facilitate community sensitisation against poor environmental hygienic practices. Waste disposal measure such as \\n‘composting' can also be encouraged.\\nl Preventing pooling of wastewater in our villages- It is a health hazard as \\nit acts as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other harmful organisms. It \\nalso creates problems in movement of people and is dangerous particularly \\nfor children .\\nl Stopping water logging around water sources like hand pump or wells- The waste water from houses also adds to water logging if there are no \\nprovisions for proper drainage.\\nl Making kitchen gardens and Soak-pits around sources of waste water- \\nThese are easy methods for disposal of wastewater. Kitchen gardens for \\ngrowing vegetables and fruits help in absorbing extra water. In villages \\nfinding small places around every house for kitchen gardens may not be difficult. Soak-pits are a good way to stop pools of water, particularly in \\nstreets and common pathways. They absorb water without forming a pool. \\n(Annexure-9 shows you how make a soak-pit)\\nl Creating drainage systems- Apart from these measures, the village may still need a proper drainage system.

Disease is often used \\nto refer to any condition that causes pain,  dysfunction,  distress,  or death to \\nthe person afflicted. It usually affects people not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically, as diseases can alter one’s perspective on life and their personality.\\nDiseases can also be classified as communicable and non-communicable \\ndisease.\\nCommunicable diseases – These are diseases that spread from one person to \\nanother either directly or through a carrier such as a mosquito or flies. Some \\nexamples of such diseases are: Common colds, (directly) Diarrhoeal diseases (flies), Malaria (mosquitoes), and Tuberculosis (directly). Steps must be taken \\nto prevent their spread from the persons affected to other people in the \\ncommunity.\\nNon Communicable diseases – They are usually associated with people’s life \\nstyles (tobacco, alcohol, obesity), pollution, and deficiency or excess of some \\nnutrients. They never spread from one person to another. Some common examples are high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and many other \\nillnesses. \\nIn our community we may notice some people living with various physical and \\nmental disabilities such as deafness, blindness etc. Physical and mental injuries \\ndue to accidents such as road accident/accidents which occur at work and \\nanimal bites also belong to this category. \\nHealing \\nOur body has its own defence, or way to resist diseases and heal itself. In most \\ncases, these natural defence mechanisms are more important to our health than medicines. \\nHave you seen how a tree heals its axe injury? First the gum fills the gap. The gum \\nhardens and gradually becomes wooden. A similar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. \\nEven in a case of more serious illness, when a medicine is needed, it is the body \\nthat must overcome the disease; the medicine only helps. Cleanliness, rest, adequate nutritious food and water are essential to help the patient recover \\nfrom the disease and live a healthy life. \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_47': '47 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Our body has its own defence mechanism (immunity) which fights against \\ngerms or diseases causing organisms. This system matures as body learns how \\nto fight germs. This helps us recover from an illness. The severity and duration of \\nillness vary with the type of the pathogen and defence mechanism of the body to resist the infection.\\nNote – Components of mother’s breast milk enable baby to fight many illnesses. \\nThe first thick milk (colostrum) is a priceless shield for the baby and should never be discarded. \\nIn case of non- communicable diseases adopting an active and healthy life \\nstyle is the key to prevent, reverse or minimise the symptoms of the diseases. Medications and supplements may also provide help in reducing the effects of \\nsuch diseases. In some severe conditions surgeries may be required. \\nTreatment for Diseases\\nHealing with traditional medicines\\nThere are certain traditional ways of healing and treating illnesses. \\nThe traditional systems of medicines include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, \\nSiddha and Homeopathy. There are also home remedies which are \\npassed on through generations. Many of these are of great value, cheaper and do not have harmful side effects as only natural herbs \\nand therapies are used in making them. Some common herbs \\nand home remedies have been mentioned in Annexure- 10. Some diseases are helped by traditional medicines, while others can be \\ntreated better with modern medicines.\\nTreatment with modern medicines\\nFor first contact care we need very few medicines. As an ASHA \\nyou will learn to use some medicines/drugs. For example: \\nParacetomol, Chloroquine, Iron Folic acid and ORS.\\nThe use of each drug; its dose, how many times to be given, \\nside effects, and precautions are given in Annexure11. Read this carefully before \\nusing the drugs. These medicines are safe, cheap and very effective. We will \\nlearn about some more medicines in the subsequent trainings.\\nModern medicines have side effects. Thus it is important to use them rationally \\nand prevent injudicious usage.\\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_48': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 48ASHAs Role in Promoting Rational Drug Use\\nSpread awareness in the community on \\nAvoiding overuse of injections and saline (bottle)\\nTry to overcome the prevalent belief that injections and saline are always necessary. Some \\npatients insist on injections and saline bottles. Many doctors are also driven by profit \\nmotives. You should educate people that these are useful only in certain conditions. People can save expenses with help of simple remedies. The saline in the bottle is just water, salt \\nand some sugar. If we prepare it at home and take orally the effect is the same.\\nPreventing misuse of TonicsMany doctors prescribe these tonics, because patients ask for them. Tonics are not \\nnecessary for the growth of body or to give energy. They are just a combination of \\nwater, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In most of the cases, for gaining strength and ensuring growth a simple nutritious home cooked meal \\nis enough.\\nAvoiding self-medicationPeople often buy medicines by themselves or use any medicines lying in the house for \\nconditions such as fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headaches. This should not be \\ndone. Most drugs cause side effects, and some are harmful. The side effects of some of the commonly used medicines used in self-medication are:\\nl Drugs used as pain killers: Almost all painkillers cause irritation of stomach and many of these, when taken over long periods, can cause internal bleeding and \\nstomach ulcers.\\nl Anti-allergic drugs: Are used in the treatment of cold and cough and can cause \\nsleepiness, which can sometimes cause accidents.\\nl Antibiotics: Antibiotics might cause life-threatening ‘reactions’ if a person is allergic to them. Some antibiotics can disturb intestinal bacteria and induce diarrhoea.\\nMany drugs affect our vital organs, like the liver and the kidney as these organs flush out drugs and toxins from our body. Some people also treat children with the same medications which have been prescribed to adults. This is dangerous since children \\nneed much smaller doses. Doses are given according to the body weight. Most \\nimportantly, pregnant women should not take any medicine without consulting a qualified doctor, as these could harm the unborn baby. \\nTaking correct dose of medicines\\nBoth overdose and inadequate dosage can be harmful, especially in children. People \\nshould strictly adhere to dosage and schedule of drugs as recommended by the doctor. \\nEducation about rational drug use in community will help you in your work.

Infected Wound\\n1. Care of the wounds with no bleeding\\nThese wounds include small abrasions, small cuts, scrapes and other small \\nwounds.  Prompt first aid can help nature heal small wounds and deal with \\ngerms. Bleeding is usually limited to oozing and is due to damage to minute \\nblood vessels. Even these types of wounds need to be attended immediately as they may get contaminated and become infected.\\nTake the following steps while managing these wounds:\\nl Wash your hands using soap and water\\nl Clean the wound, using pre boiled and cold water (Soap can be used if the \\nwound is contaminated with dirt. But remember excess soap may damage \\nthe flesh.) \\n Or, gently w ipe the dirt away using cotton without rubbing it. Rubbing \\ndisturbs the clot and restart bleeding, thus delaying the healing process.

Cloth should be light \\nenough to allow passage of air for quick healing. \\nl Advise the person to change the gauze or cloth every day.\\nRemember\\nAny bit of dirt that is left in a wound can cause an infection. A clean wound \\nwill heal without any medicine. Cleanliness is of first importance in preventing \\ninfection and helping wounds to heal. If a person gets a cut, scrape or wound,  \\nhe/she should be referred immediately to take Tetanus Toxoid injection.\\nFamily members should be warned to:\\nl Avoid using animal or human faeces or mud on a wound. These can \\ncause dangerous infections, such as tetanus.      \\nl Never put alcohol, tincture of iodine, or any medicine directly into a wound; doing so will damage the flesh and make healing slower.\\nl Avoid disturbing the scab (a dry covering over the wound) that has been formed.\\nl Visit a health facility if there is a deep/sharp cut for which stitches may be needed. \\n Refer persons to nearby health facility immediately in case the cut is large.\\n2. Care of the wound with bleeding: \\nMinor bleeding is readily controlled by pressure and elevation. In such cases \\na small ashesive dressing is all that is necessary.  Medical aid need only be \\nsought if the bleeding does not stop or if the wound is \\nat special risk of infection. \\nSteps to control severe external bleeding from wound: \\nl Raise the injured part\\nl Apply pressure on the wound directly by using  \\nyour fingers or palm preferably over a clean sterile \\ncloth/bandage. \\nl Hold the pressure. Don't keep checking to see if the \\nbleeding has stopped because this may damage or dislodge the clot that's forming and cause \\nbleeding to resume.\\nl If the bleeding is severe take patient to the hospital \\nimmediately and keep the pressure on. \", 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_53': '53 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l If the bleeding can not be controlled by pressing on the wound, or the \\npresure point, and if the person is losing a lot of blood you can tie the limb \\nas close to the wound as possible, keeping the wounded part raised.\\n Do not make the tie so tight that the affected area becomes blue. For \\nthe tie, use a folded cloth or a wide belt; never use thin rope, string, or wire.\\n3. Care of the infected wounds\\nAny wound which is red, swollen, hot, and painful with pus, or a foul smell is an \\ninfected wound. \\nA deep bullet or knife wound runs a high risk of dangerous infection. You can \\nknow that the infection is spreading to other parts of the body if there is fever and a red line above the wound.\\nWounds which may become dangerously infected are:\\nl Wounds with debris or made with dirty objects\\nl Puncture wounds and other deep wounds that do not bleed\\nl Wounds made where animals are kept: in cowsheds, pigpens, etc\\nl Large wounds with severe laceration or bruising\\nl Wounds due to bites, especially from dogs or other animals\\nl Bullet wound or knife wound \\nManagement of infected wounds\\nInfected wounds are serious and need immediate medical \\nattention.

Vivax is not very \\ndangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs.\\nHow does it spread?\\nWhen the mosquito bites an infected person, the parasite enters the mosquito’s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’s stomach and later when it bites another \\nperson, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’s saliva \\nand infects him/her.\\nSigns and symptoms\\nl The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with \\nFalciparum type infection.

If RDT is positive for \\nmalaria- Chloroquine or Artesunate Combination treatment (ACT) treatment \\nshould be given. Your local health department would tell you which of the two possible treatments should be chosen. If despite treatment fever does not \\nbegin to come down within two or three days, or persists even after a week, \\nthe patient must seek treatment from a hospital. (Treatment guidelines for Malaria are provided in Table C – Annexure 10)\\nPrevention of Malaria\\nMosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito \\nthat transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at \\nnight. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in \\nclean water. In rainy season, wherever water collects, it forms a good breeding \\nplace for mosquitoes. It also breeds in well in streams, rice fields and  \\nover-head water tanks.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_64': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 64Ways of controlling malaria: There are two ways:\\nDo not allow mosquito to \\nmultiply\\nl Not allowing water to \\nstagnate, and pouring a \\nspoon of oil over the water \\nsurface in small collections.

Sometimes, the \\nnewborn can die immediately after birth due to asphyxia (difficulty in \\nbreathing). The ANM or the doctors attending the birth usually clear the airway and resuscitate the baby. In case of a home delivery, where \\nthere is no skilled birth attendant you should immediately refer the \\nbaby to the nearest health facility, as in such circumstances the time to save the baby is very short.\\nNormal care at birth\\nl  Drying the newborn: Baby should be cleaned gently with a clean soft moist cloth and the head wiped dry with a dry soft clean cloth. \\nl  Ensuring warmth: The baby should be kept warm and in close skin to skin contact with the mother. It should be wrapped in several layers of clothing \\nor woollen clothing depending upon the season. The room should be warm \\nenough for an adult person to just feel uncomfortable; free from moisture and strong wind. The family and mother should be counselled to avoid \\nbathing the baby till at least first seven days after birth. A newborn loses \\nbody heat very quickly and if it is left wet or exposed, its body temperature may fall suddenly and cause sickness which can kill the baby. \\nl  Early initiation of breastfeeding: Mother should be encouraged to start breastfeeding immediately after delivery. This is beneficial for both the \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_74': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 74mother and baby since it not only makes the baby stronger but also helps \\nin quick delivery of placenta and reduces bleeding. The first yellow thick \\nmilk of the mother known as colostrum should be fed to the baby and not \\ndiscarded as it prevents the baby from infections. \\nl  Avoiding pre lacteal feeds: Honey, sugar water etc. should not be given to the baby since they can cause infection or diarrhoea. Only breast milk \\nshould be fed to the baby. \\nl  Weigh the baby: Baby should weighed immediately after birth. If the \\nweight of the baby is 2500 gms then it is a normal baby. But if the weight is \\nless than 2500 gms then special precautions have to be taken, which will be \\ntaught to you subsequently.\\nHome visits for the care of newborn\\nYou should undertake home visits to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively.

About 46% of the \\nchildren below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly \\none out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under \\nnutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, \\nadolescence and adulthood.\\nFacts about malnutrition in young children\\nl  Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the \\ncontributory factors to over half of all child deaths.\\nl  Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they find it more difficult to \\nget healthcare and also there is less time for child care.\\nl  Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using their \\nscarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition.\\nl  Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the \\ngrandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue.\\nl  It is easier to prevent a child from slipping into malnutrition than to reverse \\nit once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on counselling \\nevery family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this \\ntime, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.\\nRecognising malnutrition\\nIt is difficult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it is too ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_80': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 80late. Most children look normal but their height and weight when measured \\nis less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child \\nmonthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the \\nchild can be classified as mild, moderate or severely underweight.\\nSick children need special attention. However, families of all children especially \\nchildren below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent \\nmalnutrition.\\nSix important messages for preventing child malnutrition\\n1. Exclusive Breastfeeding\\nl  Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; not even water \\nshould be added.\\n2. Complementary Feeding\\nl  At the age of six months, add other foods. Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least \\none to two years more. There are five things to remember about \\ncomplementary feeding:\\nl Consistency: Initially the food has to be so_ and mashed. But later, anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less \\nspices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. \\n‘give daal not daal ka pani’ .\\nl Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as \\nthe mother.\\nl Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given \\nshould be equal to about half what the adult needs in terms of \\nnutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has \\nto be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day.\\nl Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family \\ncould add a spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever \\nedible oil is available in the house is sufficient.\\nl Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the greener it is, or the more red it is the more its \\nprotective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, fish are liked by children \\nand very nutritive and protective.\\n3. Feeding during the illness\\nl  Give as much as the child will take; do not reduce the quantity of food. After the illness, to catch up with growth, add an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a \\nmajor cause of malnutrition.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_81': '81 Induction Training Module for ASHAs 4. Prevent illness\\nl  Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are six important \\nthings to remember which could prevent illness:\\nl Hand washing: before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s food, and after cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the \\nsingle most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea. \\nl Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of \\nparticular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.\\nl Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that \\ncause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are \\nmore common and life threatening, than in normal children.\\nl Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and then repeated once every six months till five years of age. This too \\nreduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in \\nmalnourished children. \\nl Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during \\nthe illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more \\nrigorous in hand washing and more careful in handling the baby. \\nl Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of \\nmalnutrition. You should encourage parents and other family members \\nto spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the \\nchild. Such children eat and absorb food better.\\n5. Access to health services\\nl Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. On the \\nvery first day of the illness, if you help the mother decide on whether it is a \\nminor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be referred \\nto a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.\\nl Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a \\nmuch higher chance of the children being malnourished.\\n6. Access to anganwadi services\\nl The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the age \\nof 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations. \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_82': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 82Malnourished children are to be given additional food supplements. For \\nchildren below the age of two, take – home rations are to be given. Even \\npregnant women and lactating mothers up to six months are entitled to \\nget food supplements in the anganwadi centres. _ Weighing the baby \\nand informing the family of the level of malnutrition is another important \\nanganwadi service. \\nl The anganwadi is also the site where the Village Health and Nutrition Day \\n(VHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is given \\nimmunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) \\npackets or drugs needed for illness management.\\nNote\\nWasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families \\ntend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very \\ncostly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally \\navailable nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors \\nfor the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could \\nalso be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.\\nCounselling on Malnutrition\\nAll the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, \\nmany of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not \\nbe possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps; first an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding \\nof this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.\\nFor an analysis, we need to know the following\\nl  What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, \\nmoderately underweight or severely underweight?\\nl  What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?\\nl  What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?\\nl  What is the family’s access to the three key services?

It is a transition period of life \\nwhere an individual is no longer a child, but not yet an adult\\nDevelopmental changes during adolescence\\nAs a part of growing up, adolescents go through puberty. Puberty is the time in life when body changes from that of a child to an adult. These developmental \\nchanges occur under the influence of chemicals in our body called hormones. \\nThe changes are:\\nl  Physical Changes \\n In Girls: The body changes shape by becoming more rounded, the breasts \\ngrow, the hips widen, hair grows in the armpits and private parts. This \\nhappens between 10-16 years of age. The onset of menstruation (bleeding every month) is an important change occurring among girls during the \\nadolescent years.\\n In Boys: The shoulders widen, height increases suddenly, the voice changes \\nand becomes deeper and hair begins to grow in the armpits, private parts \\nand the face.\\nl  Emotional Changes: Include shyness, rapid mood changes, lack of \\nconfidence, attention seeking behaviour, strong peer influence, sexual \\nattraction, desire to establish own identity and independent thinking. During \\nthis period unhealthy habits like smoking and drinking or experimenting with drugs and unsafe sex can also set in.\\nl  Social Changes: Conflicts with the family over control, strong influence of the peer group on behaviour and the formation of new relationship.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_98': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 98Why is it Important to Focus on Adolescent Health?\\nAdolescent years are formative years and set our physical, emotional, and \\nbehavioural patterns. Foundations of future health are laid in this period. \\nIncreasing awareness, practice of healthy behaviours, building self- esteem and \\nconfidence in this age group results in confident healthy adults.\\nMajor adolescent health concerns\\nThere are certain health issues which are specific to this age group and have to be managed appropriately. These include: \\nMenstruation in girls\\n(Understanding Menstruation and Problems during menstruation)Menarche: The onset of puberty, when the girl has her first period is called \\nMenarche and generally takes place between 9-16 years of age. During this \\nperiod, most girls have bleeding for the first time from the vagina which becomes a periodic occurrence in a girl’s life. Each cycle of bleeding is observed \\nin a gap of 28-40 days.\\nWhy does menstruation occur?In a girls’ body at puberty, every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of \\nthe eggs from the ovary, travels through pipes called fallopian tube. This is \\ncalled ovulation. As the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a soft spongy lining Note:\\nl The normal time for onset of puberty is 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 \\nyears in boys.\\nl  These changes start 1-2 years earlier in girls as compared to boys. The rate and extent of change is variable in different individuals. In a group \\nof individuals who are growing together this variation often leads to \\nanxiety –“Am I normal?” and needs reassurance.\\nl Any cases showing delay, such as- menstruation not starting by 16 years in girls needs referral to a doctor. \\nl Early onset of puberty signs in girls (before eight years) and boys (before nine years) is also a matter of concern and should be referred for further \\nexamination.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_99': '99 Induction Training Module for ASHAs gets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of tiny blood vessels. \\nIn case an egg and sperm meet to form an embryo, or a baby, that begins to \\ngrow in the uterus this lining provides the nutrition for the baby. If the egg is \\nnot joined by a sperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The unfertilised egg along with broken uterine lining is released as blood and flows out of \\nthe vagina. This bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called \\nmenstruation.\\nMenstrual Cycle\\nA menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. The typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short \\nas 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which \\ncan vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.\\nProblems faced by girls during menstruation\\nThe difficulties that girls may experience during menstruation are:Irregular Periods: For the first few years of menstruation, cycles are often \\nirregular and usually become regular within two to three years after menarche. \\nThey may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). \\nHeavy periods: Adolescents may have heavy periods lasting longer than eight \\ndays, often saturating the pad within an hour or passing large blood clots.

RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).Women are more vulnerable to these \\ninfections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. \\nsexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk..\\nWhy are these Diseases not Addressed? \\nWomen are usually shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers.

It is about a miracle that ordinary \\nwomen were able to achieve collectively. It is about a community of hard-working \\nwomen who laboured in the fields to earn their living. The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the \\nhard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), in \\nexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, they incurred debts or stole household articles like glasses, plates or even their wives’ saris. After \\ndrinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making \\ntheir lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to go straight to these shops in the evening \\nafter returning from work. They came home late at night, completely drunk They \\nwould hand over some money for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his \\nfather to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community \\nalso had an alcoholic husband, when her relatives visited her house they were scared away from the village by the obscene language of her closest neighbour, \\na heavy drinker. She felt ashamed and thought that the village would be a much \\nbetter place without arrack.\\nEveryday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women \\ndiscussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached \\nthe village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders. They expressed their problem and asked them to get remove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the \\nSarpanch, although agreeable, were unable to do anything. The next day one \\nhundred women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come into the village’ , they told the cart driver \\nstrongly in unison and stood in front of it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them \\noffered him a rupee to do so. The driver got scared and left the village.\\nThen a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded \\nthat it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police came to the \\nvillage and said that all those who bid at auctions had the right to sell arrack. The women stood unmoved. They said that they would go to the Collector and would \\nnot keep quiet if arrack was sold in their village. The arrack contractors got cold feet.  Annexure 4: Anti Arrack Movement', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_124': 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 124They made several plans, but nothing worked and they gave up. These events gave \\nstrength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and \\nstruggled strongly to get rid of arrack from their village.\\nThe story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the \\ndistrict.\\nIn the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community \\nthrough puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village, with the result that women in other villages did the \\nsame.\\nThe women in Dubagunta started a movement in which ultimately the situation \\nchanged for the better.\\nIn 1991 was the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor) Movement, which finally \\nled to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on 16 January 1995.\\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHA English_125': '125 Induction Training Module for ASHAsObservation Checklist for Sub-Centre \\nGeneral information \\nName of the sub-centres village_____________ \\nTotal population covered by the sub-centre_____________ Distance from the \\nPHC _____________ \\nAvailability of staff at the sub-centre \\nl Is there an ANM available/appointed at the centre?

For elderly \\ncare, it is necessary to know how many elderly persons currently bed-bound, restricted \\nand mobile . Thus, the identification and listing is an important task.

These individuals may require special care. They should also be visited \\nfrom time to time and provided with psychosocial support. This will also help to establish a \\ncommunication between the primary health care team and the identified elderly.\\n2.

This \\nincludes an increase in institutional deliveries, immunization coverage, improvements in infant and child health, and reductions in maternal and infant deaths. You, as an ASHA, have played a large role in making this happen. \\nYou were selected as an ASHA to serve your community and improve health outcomes \\nfor the people. So far, you have been trained on topics related to maternal, new born, child health, nutrition and infectious diseases. You were also trained on issues such as improving communication skills, negotiation and building community relationships, reaching the most vulnerable or remote populations, and on addressing violence against women in the community. \\nThe country has made progress in improving maternal and child health and communicable \\ndiseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy. But now, we face another set of health challenges. You must have heard in your community that people complain of having high blood pressure or high blood sugar or suffering from cancers. \\nThese complaints are heard across the country. More and more people are affected by \\ndiseases like heart attacks and stroke, cancer, asthma and breathing difficulty, mental disorder injuries, kidney, liver and other problems. These diseases are called Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). \\nThis module will tell you more about these NCDs. It will also guide you on how you can \\nhelp people in the community in preventing NCDs and in identifying and supporting those who are affected by them. However, you must remember that your efforts on community prevention and control of communicable diseases and in improving maternal child health, continue to be important.\\nLet us first understand what we mean by Non-Communicable Diseases?\\nNCDs are diseases of long duration. These are non-infectious conditions that cannot be transmitted to other individuals. Some NCDs progress slowly or cause chronic symptoms requiring long term care and control while others progress rapidly. They affect adult men and women but children are vulnerable as well. People may appear healthy but still suffer from these conditions. \\nOne of the most serious concerns about NCDs is that they affect people in the productive \\nyears of their life. They also cause “premature deaths” -  that is, a death occurring before the average life expectancy. Though NCDs can affect a person at any age, older individuals are more vulnerable to NCDs.Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_2': '2   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesIn this module, you will be trained on five common NCDs:\\nl\\tHypertension.\\nl\\tDiabetes.\\nl\\tCervical Cancer.\\nl\\tBreast Cancer.\\nl\\tOral Cancer.\\nBesides these, there are other NCDs like epilepsy, asthma and other respiratory \\ndiseases, but you will be taught about them in later modules. \\nAs an ASHA, you are in the unique position of being able to reach every individual \\nand family.

Health promotion messages should be adapted to the local needs of the community and take into account different behaviours and lifestyles.

His teeth are discoloured and he keeps getting ulcers in his mouth. \\nRani and Shyam have moved from a rural area of Bihar to an urban construction site near Delhi. They are both construction workers and are at the working site from morning till evening. Because of the long working hours, Rani is too tired to cook at home. They regularly buy food from a nearby stall which sells deep fried ready to eat food like samosa, kachori, pakora, poori-sabji etc. and enjoy eating this food. Shyam also consumes alcohol on a daily basis.\\nRafia is 40 years old. Recently she noticed a lump in her breast. Her mother and aunt had a history of breast cancer. Her aunt died when she was 45 years old.\\nShabnam is a 50-year-old resident of Ratanpur. Both her parents \\nhad high blood pressure and her father died of stroke.\\nIn these cases, we illustrate the various risk factors that are responsible for NCDs. Risk factors can be of two types: Non-modifiable and Modifiable risk factors.', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_8': '8   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesThe diagram below shows how risk factors can lead to NCDs. The more risk factors one \\nhas, the greater is the chance of getting a particular disease.\\nNon-modifiable risk factors\\nThese risk factors are inherent to an individual and cannot be changed, such as age, family history and sex (as seen in the case of Rafia and Shabnam). \\nl\\tAge: With increasing age, our body undergoes changes. As we grow older, there is an \\nincrease in the risk of developing high blood pressure, (Hypertension), high blood sugar levels, (Diabetes), high levels of body fat and blood fats. These conditions can lead to Non-Communicable Diseases like -  heart and blood vessel diseases (stroke), diabetes, cancer, respiratory problems, etc. \\nl\\tSex: Both women and men are at risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases. Men are at a higher risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases. However, women who have reached menopause are more likely to suffer from heart attacks than pre-menopausal women. Some risk factors for developing Non-Communicable Diseases such as high blood pressure or high blood glucose can affect women even during pregnancy.\\nl\\tFamily history: The chances of getting some NCDs are higher if a close family member -  parents, siblings also have the disease. This is called Family History. If a person has a family history of NCDs she/he has a high chance of getting the disease.\\nModifiable risk factors\\nThese are risk factors that can be changed by specific action,. The harmful effect can be reduced with changes in lifestyle and treatment. Risk factors may affect the individual such as unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption (as seen in the case of Nawab, Rani and Shyam). Population level risk factors include poverty, poor living and working conditions and environmental factors like pollution from factory smoke, cars and even cooking stove (chulha) in home, can increase the risk of many NCDs.\\nAt the individual level, some modifiable risk factors can be changed if the person changes \\nher/his individual behaviours.

Also, there is a law against selling of tobacco products near schools and colleges so that children do not start smoking early.\\nHaving one or more of these conditions such as -  high blood pressure, high blood \\nglucose levels, high blood fat levels and excess body fat (being overweight) can result in Cardiovascular diseases (Heart disease, Stroke), Diabetes, Cancers and Chronic Respiratory Diseases (Asthma, difficulty in breathing). \\nAre Non-Communicable Diseases Increasing? If so, then why?\\nOver the past few years, we are noticing an increase in deaths and illnesses due to Non-Communicable Diseases. Some of the reasons are: \\nl\\tPeople shifting from rural areas to urban areas and making changes in lifestyles related to diet, exercise and other behaviours.\\nl\\tIncrease life expectancy of people and thus more people living at an increasing age. \\nl\\tDecrease in physical activity due to availability of motor vehicles for transport.\\nl\\tLack of adequate, safe spaces for regular exercise.\\nl\\tAvailability and use of tobacco and alcohol for all age groups.\\nl\\tIncreased use of foods high in fats, salt, sugar and sugar sweetened beverages.\\nl\\tLow consumption of fruits and vegetables because of high costs/lower availability. \\nl\\tIncreased consumption of refined foods (foods that are available in packaged form).\\nl\\tGrowing environmental pollution (air, food, water).\\nWhat is the Effect of Non-Communicable Diseases on the Poor \\nand Women?\\nA common perception is that Non-Communicable Diseases \\nare a disease of the rich. However, this understanding is not correct. Poor and vulnerable people can suffer from NCDs too. Two important factors that can cause NCDs are poverty and malnutrition. \\nAs you know, many children are born with low birth \\nweight (weighing less than 2.5 kg at birth). The lack of nutrition for the baby while in the womb, has consequences in adulthood. While growing up, the bodies of such Low birth weight babies are not able to adapt to fatty or sugary foods. This results in an increase in risk factors like hypertension, high blood fat levels, and high blood glucose levels.\\nPoverty contributes to NCDs in several ways, including maternal malnutrition. Also, poor \\npeople are not able to buy and consume healthy foods such as nuts, fresh fruits, etc. As \\n', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_10': '10   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseasesa result, they often can only afford to eat rice or roti, with no pulses or vegetables. Also, \\nparticularly in the case of urban poor, long working hours do not leave them enough time to cook healthy meals, such as the use of leafy green vegetables or healthy grains that take longer to cook. The poor also live in places where there are higher risks of air pollution, such as near factories which release harmful chemicals. So, you can see that the risks of NCDs can be higher among the poor, when compared to the rich, who may have more time and money to invest in healthier lifestyles.\\nNon-Communicable Diseases are also associated with higher health care costs due to \\nlong and expensive treatment. With NCDs, you cannot stop taking medicines once you feel better – you have to keep taking them to keep illness away, often for a lifetime. But many people stop taking medicines once they feel better or when they run out of money. These illnesses also require close monitoring and regular follow up by a health service provider. The poor may not be able to visit a health centre regularly as that would mean loss of wages. High transportation costs to and from the health facility, lower energy to do work, lack of money to make healthy food choices and stress, are added factors leading to higher levels of Non-Communicable Diseases among the poor.\\nTreatment for Non-Communicable diseases is generally spread over a long period of time. \\nIn case of complications, people may need hospitalisation. This can lead to financial hardship. Such illnesses of even one family member could affect the family’s income. This may result in the children dropping out of school, or even affect the consumption of nutritious food for the rest of the family.\\nWomen are particularly disadvantaged as they are often more vulnerable because of their \\nstatus within the family and society. Poverty is a factor that increases this vulnerability. In comparison to men, they lack access to healthcare, have little control over the household income and are unable to make decisions for themselves regarding care and treatment. Also, as a tradition in many households, women eat leftovers which may not constitute a healthy dietary choice. Therefore, it is important to increase women’s awareness about Non-Communicable Diseases and ensure that they participate in screening and treatment programmes. ', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_11': 'Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   11Why do People use T obacco and Alcohol?\\nMany people start smoking/chewing tobacco and consuming alcohol in their early \\ntwenties or even earlier. Adolescents may begin to use tobacco or alcohol in order to act older, or as a way of experimenting, to gain social acceptance among peers, or in stressful situations. Adults begin to smoke and drink to either overcome stress or pressures of daily life or for pleasure. Individuals react differently to the amount of alcohol they drink. While some individuals experience ill effects with even small quantities of alcohol, others can consume larger quantities without any harmful effects appearing immediately. \\nIt is also important to remember that in some parts of our country, drinking alcohol is \\npart of the local tradition. Your task is to understand the harmful consequences of the use of these substances and communicate this to the people of your community. \\nWhat are the Various Forms in which T obacco is Used?\\nThere are smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco.\\nl\\t\\tSmoking tobacco can be in the form of cigarettes, bidis, cigars, hukkahs or pipes. Bidi smoking is the most popular form of tobacco smoking in India.\\nl\\t\\tSmokeless tobacco is consumed through chewing (through the mouth), sucking and applying tobacco preparations to the \\nteeth and gums or inhaling.

Exposure to second hand smoking is called Passive Smoking. Children and women are especially exposed to the dangers of second-hand smoke, if they have a family member who smokes.\\nPassive smoking is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, heart attack, difficulty \\nin breathing, coughing, asthma, ear infection, irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and long-term negative effects on the brain. \\nEffects of tobacco use \\nTobacco use is dangerous. The negative health effects include both long-term (i.e. future) and short-term (i.e. immediate) effects.

They include improvement in breathing, reduction in risk of heart attack, or cancer and improved health. However, giving up tobacco causes withdrawal symptoms for which the person needs to be supported by her/his family.\\nWithdrawal symptoms\\nWhen a person quits the habit of tobacco consumption, they are likely to have “withdrawal symptoms” . These include:\\nHeadache Anxiety/feeling of worry, concern\\nNausea/vomiting Depressed mood\\nConstipation or diarrhoea Increased hunger\\nFatigue (tiredness), drowsiness and \\ndifficulty in sleepingIncreased desire for the taste of sweets\\nIrritability Desire for tobacco\\n \\nWithdrawal symptoms can be reduced by the support and encouragement of family and \\nfriends, finding ways of keeping oneself busy, drinking plenty of fluids, regular exercise, sufficient sleep and eating a balanced diet, or even simple things like carrying out deep breathing exercises.\\nWhat are the Various Forms of Alcohol?\\nAlcohol is consumed in India in many forms by all age groups: adolescents, men, women and older adults.

In \\nthis module, you will learn how healthy eating habits are important in preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases.\\nThere are four basic food groups listed in the table below. Eating foods from all food \\ngroups is called Dietary Diversity. It means that foods from all the basic four food groups should be eaten in proper quantities. \\nThe quantity of foods needed to meet body requirements differ with age, gender, body \\ncomposition and physical activity. Thus those who engage in heavy work need to eat more, but those who do not do much activity need lower quantities. Many traditional foods that are fibre-rich like whole products -  wheat (atta products), jowar, bajra, maize, unhusked dals (with chilka), fruits and vegetables constitute a Healthy Diet. Eating such foods also helps to maintain a healthy body weight and reduces the risk of NCDs. Some Non-Communicable Diseases require food restrictions. People suffering from NCDs require specific dietary advice.2.2: Healthy Diet and Physical Activity\\n2.2.1.

Beverages like water, buttermilk, lassi, coconut water, should be consumed instead of bottled soft drinks and readymade fruit juices.\\nPoverty as an underlying cause for unhealthy food choices \\nMost information that is available through advertisements and newspapers, highlight that unhealthy foods (foods particularly rich in fats, sugars and salt). are the reasons for causing NCDs. They also urge people to eat more fruits, nuts and vegetables, eat more often, and use healthy oils in their cooking. \\nThese messages assume that such healthy foods are easily available to everyone, and that \\npeople have the time and money to purchase and prepare healthy foods.\\nHowever, poor people are unable to afford such dietary items on a regular basis.. Poor \\npeople tend to eat larger quantities of foods that are cheap but do not have much nutritional value. For instance, you will find people eating five or six chapattis, but with hardly any vegetables or only watery dal. Among rice eating communities, poor people cannot afford pulses and vegetables so they may eat a large quantity of rice, with just a little dal or buttermilk. \\nAlso, in rural areas, poor people may farm on plots of borrowed land. Even though they \\ncultivate healthy grains/pulses or fruits and vegetables the major share of the harvest is taken away by the landowners.\\nOver the past few decades several environmental factors, changes in farming practices \\n(farmers are no longer cultivating traditional grains and have shifted to wheat/rice cultivation) and food marketing strategies have affected the quality of diets. It has also resulted in decreased consumption of locally and regionally available foods which are nutritionally adequate (rich in all vital nutrients).

The key message is most NCDs are preventable and also that NCDs including cancer can be treated if detected early.\\nIn completing the formats and CBAC, you will be asking individuals for Aadhaar numbers. \\nPlease note that every individual has to provide their consent to giving you the number. At Annexure 3, is a consent form that every individual must sign.\\n3. Screening\\nScreening is an activity where a person even though she/he is apparently healthy, is examined physically, or with the help of equipment or tests to identify if they have a disease condition. Individuals with Non-Communicable Diseases may appear healthy, so it is important to screen adults at regular intervals. This time period is different for different conditions. For hypertension and diabetes screening should be conducted every year, and for cancers once in five years. \\nOn a fixed day, every week, the ANM will undertake \\nscreening for hypertension, diabetes, oral and breast cancer. Until the ANMs are trained for detecting cancer of the cervix, screening for cancer cervix will take place at the PHC/CHC nearest the village. Depending on the distance the screening by ANMs can take place at the village or at the sub- centre. In urban areas, this can take place in the Urban PHC or outreach sessions. Screening involves examination of the mouth and the breast by the ANM, measurement of BP and glucose. \\nT arget population (for screening):\\nl All men and women of 30 years and above for Oral cancer, Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus.\\nl\\t All women of 30 years and above for cervical and breast cancer.\\nYour tasks prior to the screening day are to mobilise the community to attend the screening on the date and time of the ANMs visit to the village or the date on which they need to go to the sub centre.\\nYou should remember that most of the people will at first not agree to being examined, \\nsince they are healthy. You will need to use your skills to convince people that screening would help to identify disease conditions that may not have symptoms till the disease is advanced. If you find it difficult to convince any individual, you can ask the ASHA facilitator and ANM to visit the family along with you and explain the importance of screening.\\nOn a particular day, about 30 people can be screened. Thus, in twelve or thirteen days \\nyou can screen the target population. These will be spread over the entire year. The ANM will make a schedule for screening in her area-and you will get the dates for your area from her. This also means that you will have to make sure that the number of people on a particular screening day, do not exceed thirty. Otherwise the ANM will be overburdened and crowd management will be difficult. You will also help the ANM in recording the \\n', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_52': '52   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseasesmeasurements. On every screening day, you also have to ensure that VHSNC and MAS \\nmembers are also present and support you in undertaking health promotion activities. \\nThere are also likely to be people in your community who have already been diagnosed \\nwith one of these conditions. Their BP and glucose should be measured on a monthly basis and not necessarily on the screening day. \\n4. Undertaking Health Promotion\\nIn chapter 1, you have learnt about the importance of health promotion. You have also learnt about how to undertake health promotion related to specific risk behaviours. You have learnt how healthy lifestyles like diets, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco and harmful drinking, etc ,can lead to prevention of diseases. You will need to make sure that health promotion activities are continuous and not limited to the screening day alone. You can also undertake health promotion during home visits and community meetings, including meetings of the VHSNC/MAS.\\n5. Undertaking Follow-up for T reatment Adherence and Enabling \\nLifestyle Changes\\nIf an individual is referred by the ANM to the PHC-MO, you will need to follow up with \\nthem or even escort them to the health facility. Your task is to ensure that all individuals who are asked by the ANM to visit the health facility actually are examined by the MO. Some of them may be put on treatment for blood pressure or diabetes. Some may need to go to a CHC or district hospitals for confirmation of cancer. At Annexure four is a list of health care services for each condition that is available at the various levels of facility, including referral sites.\\nOnce an individual is put on treatment for hypertension or diabetes the treatment is most \\nlikely lifelong. Your task is to make sure they obtain their supply of drugs from the sub centre or PHC, and are regular in taking the medicines. You will also need to undertake home visits to ensure that they are making changes in their life style and adopting positive health behaviours. This will reduce the likelihood of complications. \\nSometimes patients may complain of symptoms that could be a result of side effects of \\nmedicines. You must refer them to the MO in the PHCs. In the case of cancer patients, the treatment is at the level of a medical college or specialised cancer treatment centre. However, when the patient returns home you should follow up to provide support and enable referral in case of any symptoms. ', 'ASHA NCD Module-English_53': 'Key Tasks of the ASHA   |   53\\n6. Creating Patient Support Groups \\nAs an ASHA, you should try to form groups of patients diagnosed with hypertension, \\ndiabetes and those on cancer treatment. Patients/friends/families/frontline workers can form these groups to help each other by bringing them together. Setting up and managing a patient support group does not require medical qualifications. All it needs is compassion, an ability to form groups conduct meetings and ensure that members are sensitive to each other’s needs.\\nPatient support groups help patients and their family members by providing mutual support, \\nproviding information about diseases, raising awareness about complications, countering discrimination and stigma attached to a particular disease and enabling support for treatment continuation and changes in lifestyle behaviour. As an ASHA, you should ensure that individuals who are part of marginalised groups and have a disease condition are also encouraged and supported to become part of these groups. You will speak at first to individual patient with a particular condition and tell them about the benefits of participating in such a group. Then you could even start with 2-3 individuals and their families/friends and enable regular meetings. Slowly people will join as word spreads.\\nAs you complete your training in this book, you will have learnt a lot about these non- \\ncommunicable diseases. You will have understood that all of them share several common features, particularly in relation to the modifiable risk factors - diet, physical activity, \\nuse of tobacco and alcohol. All of these can be addressed through \\nhealth promotion efforts. Undertaking health promotion is a very \\nimportant part of addressing non communicable diseases. There \\nwill be initial difficulties especially since it is hard to change \\nbehaviours, but with patience and practice you \\nwill become more confident in helping people. \\nThis will make you a trusted member of the community. Remember that you can always go \\nto the ANM, nurse or medical officer in your \\nPHC to clarify your doubts.

All parts of the eye are very delicate, so it is \\nimportant they remain well protected. \\nThe eyes are covered and protected by the eyelids and the eyelashes, which help protect from \\nany injury and keep dirt, dust, particles and even harmful bright light out of the eye. \\nThe Human Eye consists of: \\nTwo !! eyelids in each eye - Upper and Lower.  \\nThe !! cornea – central transparent dome like layer that covers the front of the eye. \\nThe !! pupil, or black \\ncircle at the centre \\nof the eye, is an \\nopening through which light can enter the eye.\\nThe \\n!! iris, or coloured \\npart of the eye \\n(people have black, \\nbrown, green or blue colour eyes).

The rays from the object are \\nfocused through the cornea, enter the eye through pupil, then the lenses to reach finally into the \\nback of eye, that is the retina. From here, signals are sent to a special nerve called optic nerve \\nand that helps in forming the images that we see. If any part of this vision process is damaged, then the person will have a difficulty in seeing properly. \\nHuman beings have two eyes. We see differently with one eye than we can see using both the \\ntwo eyes. Seeing from both the eyes helps us in getting the overall real picture of the objects.\\n2.3 Checking the Eyesight to identify people with poor vision (blindness \\nand low vision) in the community\\nYou will use finger counting method and 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart) at the community \\nlevel. \\nA.

There is gradual loss of vision from the affected eye. Without treatment it will deteriorate/\\nworsen further.\\n2. The person may complain of hazy (cloudy/blurred) vision as if there was something over their eyes.\\n3. The person may complain that he/she has to change his/her spectacles/glasses very frequently but are still not able to see clearly with the use of spectacles/glasses. \\n4. The person may also complain that he/she finds it difficult to tolerate bright light or glare (strong light).\\n3.1.3 Treatment of Cataract\\nAny person who has cataract in any eye will have to undergo an operation or a procedure  \\nin a hospital where eye surgeries are done. There is no other treatment for this condition.  \\nDuring this operation, they will remove the damaged lens and replace it with a new  \\nartificial lens. You should also know that adult persons with diabetes are more likely to develop early Cataract. \\nSuch persons should get their annual eye examination done by an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist. \\nAlso, look for children whose families have complained of their child having poor vision and \\ncoordinate with the RBSK team for further management.

Preparation before Cataract surgery\\n1. The patient must be checked by the doctor to determine which eye has the cataract. \\n2. Before surgery is done, simple investigations like blood pressure measurement, blood sugar, \\nurine examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) is done and advice about date of surgery and general precautions will be explained to the affected person. \\n3. Some persons delay their operation. It is important to note that delaying the surgery may increase the chance of complications after the surgery. So, it is better to get operated early \\nand avoid any complications.\\n4. The person undergoing cataract surgery must understand that proper rest will be required \\nafter the surgery, and that there should not be any exposure to dust, smoke or pollution. \\n5. Any person with cough or other problems must first get that treated before getting a cataract \\nsurgery. \\nB. Post-surgery information\\n1. The operated eye should \\nbe protected with an eye \\nshield. \\n2. The operated eye should be protected from bright \\nlight, TV screen, mobile, computer, dust, smoke, \\nsmoke from chullas and \\njerks (quick, sharp, sudden movement) for time period as suggested by the doctor. Need for using protective eye wear such as dark eyeglasses during daytime will be advised by the doctor.  1. It is normally seen in elderly people and is a result of ageing. However, it can also occur \\nin younger age groups and in children. Adult persons with diabetes are more likely to \\ndevelop Cataract at an early age.\\n2. It cannot be cured by putting any eye drops/eye ointment. Cataract can be cured ONLY \\nwith eye surgery. \\n3. The eye procedure commonly involves taking out the affected lens from the eye and replacing it with a new artificial lens so that vision can be restored to normal.\\n4. This procedure for correction of cataract is safe and commonly done, but only in a recognised hospital by an \\nEye Specialist/Eye Doctor.  It cannot be done in the Community or \\nat AB-HWCs.\\n5. Under the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment, government Eye Hospitals and Non-Governmental Organisations provide free cataract surgeries to affected people.\\n6. In adults, who have cataract due to ageing, both eyes may be affected and treatment may be required for both the eyes.\\nPatient with Eye Shield after Cataract Surgery\\nSource: Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai.', 'Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA_11': 'How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 113. The Eye Doctor will advise the patients for putting eye drops/eye ointment in the operated \\neye. These should be done correctly for the period prescribed. Refer to Annexure-1 and \\nAnnexure-2 for correct steps to administer eye drops and eye ointment, respectively. \\n4. The patient should not rub the operated eye.\\n5. The patient should not put water into the operated eye but should maintain hygiene around \\nthe eye by cleaning it. The area around the eye can be cleaned by using cotton. Take a bowl of water and cotton, boil the water and let it cool. Now, cotton can be used to put water around \\nthe eye. This can be done every morning by the patient for at least 10 days after the surgery.\\n6. Avoid having a head bath for at least 5 days after cataract surgery. \\n7. The patient should not sleep on the same side as the operated eye at least for one week. \\n8. Avoid lifting heavy objects, doing exercises for 4-6 weeks and avoid applying kajal/any eye make-up for at least 4 weeks.\\n9. Normal balanced diet should be taken by the patient after the surgery.\\n10. After the cataract surgery is done, it is important for the patient to visit and consult eye doctor \\nafter one week of operation and then after one month of operation. \\n11. If there are any complaints in the operated eye like redness, pain or poor vision, the patient \\nshould contact the eye surgeon/eye doctor immediately.\\n12. Patients after the cataract surgery may require spectacles depending on the type of lens used in the eye. \\nCommon Myths and Facts about Cataract \\n1. MYTH: Cataract can be treated with eye drops.\\n FACT: Only surgery can treat cataract.\\n2. MYTH: Cataract surgery is dangerous.\\n FACT:  It is one of the safest operations.\\n3. MYTH: It can take a long time to recover after cataract surgery.\\n FACT: Most of the patients resume normal activity and restore their vision within one week-\\none month time period.\\n4. MYTH: Cataract is reversible.\\n FACT: No. Once the cataract occurs, it is not reversible and it will progress to further reduce \\nvision. \\n5. MYTH: Cataract surgery can be done only in winter season.\\n FACT:  Cataract surgery can be done in any season. Any individual who has undergone cataract operation in one eye, must be counselled to not \\nneglect the other eye. Ensure the individual pays attention to the other eye to avoid any \\ncomplications.

It is the commonest eye problem and affects all age groups. Uncorrected \\nrefractive errors also are one of the commonest causes of visual impairment (low vision problems) \\nin India.\\n3.2.1 Symptoms of r efractive Errors\\nThe common symptoms of Refractive Errors are:\\n1. Diminished (poor) vision and difficulties in seeing distant objects or near objects\\n2. Tiredness and watering of eyes\\n3. Headache/eye ache or eye pain\\n4. Frequent blinking/squeezing eyelids or rubbing of eyes\\n5. Recurrent formation of stye in the eye\\n6. Frequent itching of the eye\\n7. Eyelid swelling\\n8. Some children may have squint (cross eyes) ', 'Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA_13': 'How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 133.2.2 Diagnosis of r efractive Errors\\nAt the community level, you will mobilise the community to visit the nearest AB-HWC after \\nscreening for blindness and visual impairment. The health worker at the AB-HWC will screen \\nfor visual acuity by using Snellen’s Chart and near vision chart of adult community members. \\nThe individuals with vision problems after screening at AB-HWCs will be referred to Vision Centres (where Ophthalmic Assistant is available) or to the Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist at CHC/SDH/DH/higher health facilities for complete testing and confirmation of Refractive Errors. Once \\ndiagnosed, the Ophthalmic Assistant (OA)/Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist will advise about use of \\nspectacles and arrange for spectacles for the patient.\\n3.2.3 Correction of r efractive Errors\\nRefractive errors can be treated and are commonly corrected by spectacles. Regular eye examination and measuring vision can detect the presence of refractive errors in eye and can be \\ncorrected easily. The refractive errors can be detected at government facilities by an Ophthalmic \\nAssistant or Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist and the power of spectacles can be prescribed by them. \\n3.2.4 Are there any other methods of correction of r efractive Errors, other \\nthan spectacles?\\nYes, there are other methods too, like laser surgery and lenses. But the treating Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist only prescribes the best option available. Spectacles remain the best option available.\\n3.2.5 r efractive \\nErrors in children\\nRefractive errors also occur in children. \\nThe common signals \\nin children that can indicate presence of refractive errors in \\nchildren and will call \\nfor eye examination by an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist/Ophthalmic \\nAssistant are: \\n1. One eye moves or aims in a different direction than the other.\\n2. The child blinks or rubs his/her eyes excessively while watching TV or reading.\\n3. The child hits into things or drops things.\\n4. The child holds reading material or objects too close, turns head to focus.\\n5. The child frequently complains of headaches, eyestrain, double vision or blurring of vision.\\n6. The child has watering of eyes.\\n7.

For adults: When they turn 40 years, especially for near vision.\\n3.2.6 Squint \\nIn this condition, both the eyes look in different directions, also referred as \\n‘crossed eyes’. This is usually seen in \\nchildren, in early years of their life. So, when a child looks at an object, both eyes will align differently. In most cases, the \\nchild will only use one eye at a time, thus \\nstraining that eye, and losing the benefits of both eyes. \\nThe condition in most of the cases can be \\nnoticed by parents/caregivers. This situation can be corrected, if detected early and \\ntimely treatment is provided. If you get to \\nknow of such a history in your service area during your home visits or are informed by parents/caregivers that their child has problem in vision and complains of cross eyes, you \\nshould refer the child at the earliest to the nearest  AB-HWC and coordinate with the RBSK team \\nfor further management. Such children will require a detailed eye examination. In case of adults with squint, you must inform the CHO/MPW/Medical Officer available at the nearest AB-HWC for further check-up and management. \\n3.2.7 Presbyopia\\nThis is a condition that is age related and occurs in almost everybody by the age of  \\n40 years. It occurs because with old age there is degenerative changes (loss of function) in the eyes and the eyes lose \\nthe ability to accommodate (focus on near \\nobjects). In this case, the person is not able to view near objects properly and finds difficulty in reading. Other activities \\nrequiring near vision are also affected such \\nas: sorting rice and pulses/or food grains, threading the needle, reading small print on medicines, seeing the text in mobile \\nphones, etc.\\nPresbyopia can be corrected by use of spectacles easily.

What are its \\nfunctions?\\nVitamin A is one of the micronutrients required by our body. One of its functions is that to help \\nin normal eyesight. Its deficiency occurs most often in children less than five years and also in \\npregnant women. It is seen especially in poor families and malnourished children/Severe Acute \\nMalnutrition (SAM) children, children with diarrhoea and children with measles. It is also seen in situations of natural disasters like floods, drought, earthquake, etc. when there is a problem in availability of food and people are not available to have adequate diet that leads to diet deficient \\nin intake of Vitamin A. \\nDeficiency of Vitamin A can be present in \\nmany ways, one of which is loss of night \\nvision. This is called Night Blindness and \\nis the first eye sign of Vitamin A deficiency. In this condition, persons are not able to \\nsee properly when it is dark. Mothers/\\ncaregivers can complain that their child falls when it is a little dark time as they do not see objects. If it is not treated, it can \\nprogress to affect the whole eye which will \\nlead to dryness of eyes and cornea and finally to blindness.\\nYou can also visually see some dirty white \\npatch on outer side of the eye as seen in the \\npicture, called as Bitot’s Spot in individuals with Vitamin A deficiency. \\nBitot’s Spot once formed cannot be removed by Vitamin A treatment.\\n3.4.2 Food sources of Vitamin A \\nRegular consumption of vitamin A rich foods such as milk and milk products, butter, ghee; \\nwhole egg, liver, meat, chicken, fish; dark green leafy vegetables like Amaranthus leaves \\n(cholai), drumstick leaves, methi (fenugreek) leaves, spinach (palak), mustard leaves (sarson \\nsaag), turnip leaves, coriander, radish leaves, bathua leaves, mint leaves; yellow and orange vegetables and fruits like carrots, tomato, sweet potato (shakarkandi), papaya, mango, apricots (khoomani), dates, etc. and appropriate breastfeeding (colostrum is rich in Vitamin A).

It is important to ensure that all \\nconfirmed cases of diabetes get an eye check-up done once a year even if they do not have \\nany eye complaints. \\nThe problem of diabetes is increasing in our country and so are its long-term effects. As you know, \\nin diabetes, the blood glucose levels are increased. It can be controlled by taking medicines that \\nare available now at the AB-HWCs. \\nDiabetes affects many organs and one of them is the eyes. It affects mainly the back lining of \\nthe eye called the retina. It can also result in early cataract development and glaucoma. This is \\nimportant to understand, if the retina gets affected by the disease, person will have problems in his/her vision. Also, here the loss of vision is irreversible. So, as an ASHA, you must encourage \\nall the target population to get their regular eye examination as well as control their high blood \\npressure and diabetes. \\n3.9.1.1 r ole of the ASHA in prevention of eye diseases in people with Diabetes \\n1. All people aged 30 years and above with diabetes should get tested for eye disease.\\n2. Educate diabetic patients and their family members that diabetes can result in eye problems.\\n3. Educate diabetic patients about the importance of having a controlled blood sugar through various means like lifestyle modification and/or medicines. \\n4.

These children may also have difficulty in breathing and low oxygen. They may \\nbe kept in neonatal units if they are born within hospitals for support and management. \\nThese babies require an eye check-up within 30 days of birth so as to examine whether the retina \\nis okay or not.  If there is abnormal development, these babies can have blindness if not detected and treated early. Babies that are very low birth weight (<1200 gm birth weight), eye examination \\nshould be done earlier.\\nYou with support from ASHA Facilitator (AF) and/or MPW/ANM, will ensure that all babies born in \\nyour area with weight less than 1500 gm or born before 32 weeks must get an eye check-up done \\nwithin 30 days of birth through RBSK team. Inform parents about the screening, mobilise them \\nand accompany them, if required for eye examination. Ensure follow-up care of such children on a regular basis as advised by the referral centre. \\n3.10 Eye Donation\\nThe front transparent portion of the eye that covers pupil is called as cornea. In certain \\nconditions, it becomes opaque and it leads \\nto corneal blindness. Persons affected with same, can get rid of their blindness by replacing with a healthy cornea tissue. \\nDonating the eyes after death of the \\nindividual is referred as ‘Eye Donation’. \\nEye donation is an act when one person \\ncan donate their eyes to persons suffering \\nfrom corneal blindness. An eye donation helps 3-4 persons to regain their vision. \\nThere is a huge demand and the supply \\nis not sufficient for the people who need it. Thus, as a society, we need to come forward for this noble cause and help \\nour community. You should encourage \\ncommunity members to understand this and agree to donate their eyes after death. Very often the individual usually agrees, \\nbut the relatives have a problem after the \\ndeath. There is no cost involved in eye donation; even the person receiving the \\ncornea does not have to pay any amount. \\nIt is a voluntary act and is free of cost. A person of any age, sex, religion, caste can donate his/her eyes. Donated eyes are never bought or sold. In your target area, people with diabetes, hypertension and asthma can also \\ndonate their eyes after death. \\nThe eyes can be donated at home or hospital after death. The eyes/corneas are taken out by \\nthe trained team within 6 hours of death, beyond which time, eyes cannot be donated. For those \\nready to donate their eyes, the relatives must call up the nearest eye bank at National toll-\\nfree number (24X7) – 1800114770 and 1919 (for metro cities). On receiving the call, the team \\nmembers will visit them within 6 hours of death and collect the eyes/corneas.

Persons who have pledged their eyes, must inform their family members \\nregarding the pledge so that they would be able to contact the nearest eye bank after their \\ndeath. Even if the pledge has not been done, the family members can still call the eye bank and donate the eyes of the deceased person.

The primary health care \\nsystem primarily focused on delivery of care related to reproductive, maternal, new-born, child health, infectious diseases and nutrition and the newly added Non-Communicable Diseases. \\nWith the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness program, a wider range of services \\nare being rolled out with the aim of providing Comprehensive Primary Health Care to the communities. Emergency and trauma care services is one of the expanded package of services being provided through the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs).\\nAs you already know, there are some health conditions which require immediate medical care \\nand need to reach an appropriate health facility for treatment as soon as possible, usually within \\nan hour. These conditions are life-threatening and therefore it is extremely important that they \\nreceive the right care at the right time. A common example is an accident leading to severe bleeding or a person suffering a heart attack. These emergency situations may arise at any time and can affect anyone. The broad goal of emergency care is to intervene as quickly as possible to \\navoid life-threatening morbidity and death in emergency and trauma cases. You might encounter \\nsuch cases in the community during field visits or they may directly present to the SHC-HWC. This module will train you on your role in management and referral of emergency conditions.\\nWhat is an emergency?\\nAn emergency is any condition that threatens the life or well-being of a person. A health emergency comprises a range of conditions which may pose a threat to life and require immediate medical \\ncare. Emergencies that are commonly encountered in the community may span from accidents \\nand trauma to emergencies arising out of chronic diseases of the heart or lung. Trauma is one of the most common emergencies that occur in the community and a major reason for morbidity and mortality in India. The challenge with respect to most emergency and trauma cases is that they \\nare non-discriminatory in the sense that they can happen to anyone irrespective of age, gender, \\neconomic status etc.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_2': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres2 What is emergency care?\\nEmergency Care, in principle is based on three Ps:\\nPreserve Life!!\\nPromote Healing!!\\nPrevent Complications !!\\nYou as an ASHA can play a crucial role in identifying and seeking help for emergency and their \\nprevention in the community.

The emergency situations which \\ncan largely be prevented are listed below. \\n1. Accidents and trauma: Accidents leading to trauma commonly occur in the home, at the workplace, on the roads and in playgrounds. Most of these accidents are avoidable if \\nproper precautions are taken.\\n2. Burns including lightening injuries and electrocution:  Burns occurring from flames, hot \\nliquids and steam, electric shocks and certain chemicals like acids, or alkali  burns caused \\nby lime, or some alkali based toilet cleaners etc are all preventable.

You will play an important role in raising awareness among community \\nmembers about these emergencies and educating them regarding their prevention.\\nIn any case of emergency, the first step is to call for help: \\nImmediately call the ambulance (102) or any other state specific ambulance services in !!\\nplace.\\nInform the CHO and MO about the situation.!!\\nStabilization of sick or injured persons is required to prevent their condition from deteriorating \\nfurther too quickly before they can reach a medical facility for treatment. As you have learnt in \\nthe previous section, you must inform the CHO and MO and call for an ambulance as soon as you \\nsuspect an emergency. After calling for help, the victim needs to be stabilized till the time he/she is being transferred to the health facility. In this section you will learn about general and specific measures of stabilization.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_7': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 7 Caution: It is important to note that stabilization of any case of emergency requires close \\ncontact.

Removing any imminent danger to the person\\n2. Specific measures for stabilization\\n1. Removing imminent danger\\nScene safety\\nThis is done to ensure safety of self, patient as well as the bystanders \\nand removing the patient from the emergency situation wherever \\nrequired, eg. Dangerous traffic, sharp objects, slope of ground, \\nelectric live circuit, etc.\\nSafe Transport\\nOnce scene safety has been secured, with great care, lift the injured victim without bending him/her anywhere. Take special care that the head and neck do not bend. The victim should \\nbe transported in a flat condition as far as possible. However, if there is any deformity of the \\nbackbone or spine, the victim should be immobilized in that position only, and no attempt should be made to lay him/her flat.\\nIf you have help, have another person put the stretcher in place.\\nIn cases of trauma, the approach is (H)ABCDE instead of ABCDE.

Specific measures for stabilization\\nHaemorrhage/bleeding control\\nHaemorrhage or bleeding control needs to be addressed first only in the cases of trauma where \\nthere obvious visible bleeding from any part of the victim’s body. Profuse or uncontrolled bleeding \\nshould be given maximum priority. Remember that you can only manage the bleeding when the \\nbleeding is from the extremities like the hands and the legs and not internally. Internal bleeding can only be managed by a doctor, however you can attempt to control it. The procedure for haemorrhage control will be discussed in detail in the following sections.\\nNote: Whenever and wherever the concerned victim in ANY emergency situation is a pregnant \\nwoman, there could be vaginal bleeding which is heavy (Heavy bleeding is defined as a clean \\npad or cloth becoming soaked within less than 5 minutes), but is not yet shocked (they are able \\nto stand or sit up and speak normally). Any problem that might be hindering the circulation of the \\nwoman, unless rapidly treated, could lead to shock or heart failure.\\nNote: In all non-trauma cases, you shall make use of the ABCDE approach.\\nAirway\\nCheck whether the passage from nose to throat and lung is clear of obstruction. Obstruction to \\nthe airway can be caused by food, swollen tongue falling back to the throat, thick mucus or blood \\nin the airway, or any foreign body stuck in the airway. If the airway is blocked then tilt back the \\nhead of the person and lift the chin. If any visible obstruction is seen then try to remove it from \\nthe mouth with a clean cloth wrapped around your finger. \\n(Caution: If there is neck or head injury then only chin lift should be done without turning the head \\nof the person.)\\nBreathing \\nCheck whether the person is breathing properly. A person can only survive a few minutes without \\noxygen. Normal breathing rate for adults is 17-20 breaths per minute, for children between 1-5 \\nyears is 40 breaths per minute and for infants is 50 breaths per minute. In case of irregular \\nbreathing rates, arrange for oxygen for the patient. If the breathing has stopped, mouth to mouth breathing should be given. (Caution: In times of COVID-19 pandemic, care must be taken since mouth to mouth breathing might increase risk of spread of infection.)', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_9': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 9 Circulation\\nCheck for pulse (in the wrist- radial pulse, or neck- carotid pulse) to assess circulation i.e., pumping \\nof blood by the heart. Normal pulse in adults ranges between 60-90 per minute. \\nIn unconscious patients, you should always check for carotid pulse.\\nHow to feel for the carotid pulse?\\nThe pulse from the carotids may be felt on either side of the front of the neck just below !!\\nthe angle of the jaw.\\nTo check for pulse, place your index and middle fingers on your neck to the side of your !!\\nwindpipe.\\nCount the pulses you feel for 15 seconds.!!\\nMultiply this number by 4 to obtain the heart rate.!!\\nDisability\\nCheck the victim’s level of consciousness using the AVPU method.\\nA: Alert: The victim is aware and is responding to the surrounding on their own.

Their eyes will open only \\nin response to voice/calling out his/her name. \\nP: Responsive to Pain: The victim’s eyes do not open on their own and will only respond if a \\npainful stimulus is given, eg. pressure to the chest. The victim may move, moan, or cry out directly \\nin response to the painful stimuli.\\nU: Unresponsive/unconscious: The victim does not respond spontaneously and does not respond \\nto verbal or painful stimuli. \\nNote: whenever and wherever the concerned victim is a pregnant woman, sometimes you may \\nfind on AVPU assessment that the woman is Unresponsive. (Do not panic in such case and \\nremember that it is not rare to find that women experiencing pregnancy related emergencies \\ncould be unresponsive or unconscious from the intensity of pain)', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_10': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres10 Exposure \\nMinimize heat loss by covering the victim’s body.\\nIf the victim is unresponsive but breathing, turn them into a recovery position and wait for help \\nto arrive. \\nRecovery position\\nThe recovery position is when a person is lying down on their side. \\nBelow is a step-by-step depiction of placing the victim in the recovery position. \\nStep 1 Kneel beside the person, open his/her \\nairway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.\\nCaution: Do not attempt to head-tilt, \\nchin-lift if the person presents with any suspected neck injury like in road-traffic accidents.\\nStraighten his/her legs.Place the arm nearer to you at right \\nangles to his/her body, elbow bent and move the hand palm to the upper side.\\nStep 2 Bring the arm further from you across the \\nchest and hold the hand, palm outwards, against the person’s cheek.\\nStep 3 With your other hand, grasp the thigh \\nfurther from you and pull the knee up, keeping the foot flat on ground.\\nLegs straightElbow bent\\nOpen the airway \\nfirst using Head \\nand Chin tilt\\nPlace the back of \\nthe hand against \\nher/his cheek \\nand hold it there\\nGrasping the leg above \\nthe knee, roll the casualty \\ntowards youUse your knee to \\nstop the casualty \\nrolling too far.\\nHolding the \\ncasualty’s \\nhead against \\nher/his cheek as they turn \\nsupports and \\nprotects the head and face.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_11': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 11 Step 4 Keeping his/her hand pressed against \\nhis/her cheek, pull at the thigh to roll the person towards and on to her side.\\nStep 5 Tilt the head back to make sure the airway remains open. Adjust the hand under the cheek if \\nnecessary, so that the head stays in this tilted position.\\nStep 6 Adjust the upper leg, if necessary, so that both the hip and knee are bent at the right angles.\\nInfant Recovery Position: Cradle the infant in your arms, with the head tilted downwards to \\nprevent the child from choking on its tongue or by inhaling vomit. Maintain this position until you \\nget medical help. \\nThe recovery position will help in keeping their airway clear and they will be able to breathe \\nproperly. If the victim happens to vomit, this position will ensure that he/she doesn’t choke. This position prevents the tongue from falling back and blocking the throat. Since the head is slightly \\nlower than the rest of the body, it allows liquids to drain from the mouth, reducing the risk of \\nchoking on fluids or vomit. This position should also be used in fits or seizure after the shaking movements have stopped. \\n(Caution: If you suspect that the victim has suffered injury to the neck or spine, do not attempt \\nthe recovery position.)\\nWhile the ABCDE and scene safety approach is almost universal and should be carried out for \\nevery emergency situation, some other approaches could be used for particular emergency \\nsituations which are the specific measures which you shall learn in the following sections. \\n3.1. Trauma and Accidents\\n3.1.1. Recognising life threatening situations\\nThe most common warning signs of a case that is life threatening or requires immediate care, involves: \\nBleeding that will not stop\\n!!\\nBreathing problems (difficulty breathing, shortness of breath)!!\\nChange in mental status (such as unusual behavior, confusion, difficulty waking up/gaining !!\\nconsciousness)\\nChest pain!!\\nChoking!!\\nCoughing up or vomiting blood!!\\nFainting or loss of consciousness!!Head tilted \\nwell back\\nHand supporting \\nhead Bent arm gives stability. \\nBent leg presses the \\nbody up and prevents the \\ncasualty rolling forward', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_12': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres12 Trauma or severe injury to any part of the body especially head or spine injury, injury to !!\\nabdomen or other vital organs like eyes, any major or severe wound\\nSudden, severe pain anywhere in the body!!\\nSudden dizziness, weakness, or change in vision!!\\nSudden weakness in any limb or of face!!\\nSevere abdominal pain or pressure!!\\nSeizures/fits!!\\nIf the situation is found to be life-threatening, the only focus should be on keeping the victim alive \\ntill help arrives. In all cases of emergency your role is to ensure prompt stabilization and safe \\ntransport to the nearest appropriate public health facility. The stabilization process should be \\ncontinued till the arrival of ambulance. \\n3.1.2. Management protocol\\nSpecific Measures \\nTrauma or accident is the most common type of emergency. Though it can be fatal, major disability \\nor even death can be prevented by providing stabilization using two modes:\\nImmobilization!!\\nControl of bleeding!!\\nYou learnt in the previous section that you should always look for signs of bleeding and swelling. \\nYou might be able to see swelling and redness around a bone which could indicate fracture. In \\nthis sub section, we shall learn about how to suspect a fracture, immobilize an injured body part \\nof the victim and control excessive bleeding.\\nImmobilization is required whenever a fracture of bone is suspected. A patient with fracture may \\npresent with following possible signs and symptoms: \\nThe break may have been felt or heard!!\\nPain at or near the area of the injury!!\\nPain when gentle pressure is applied over the area!!\\nDifficult or impossible normal movement of the limb!!\\nDeformity, abnormal twist or shortening of limb!!\\nSwelling over and around the area!!\\nA coarse grating sound if one end of the bone moves against the other!!\\nIn case of fracture, use the RICER approach.\\n1. R: Rest the affected body part, ie., immobilization. Use splints/strips of bark/sleeve of \\ncardboard to immobilize the bone. The pictures below show how fractures in different \\nbody parts can be immobilized.\\n2. I: Ice can be applied over the suspected fractured area (only if there is no external \\nbleeding).\\n3. C: Compression of the area using a bandage but make sure it is not too tight.\\n4. E: Elevate the affected body part to prevent further swelling.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_13': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 13 5. R: Refer the person to a Medical Officer immediately. (Always remember to inform CHO \\nbeforehand) \\nCaution:\\nNever rub or massage a broken body part or the skin above a bone that you suspect to !!\\nbe broken.\\nWherever a severe injury is seen especially to the neck, immobilize using heavy !!\\ntowels or rolled sheets on both sides of the neck or hold the head and neck to prevent \\nmovement. \\nIf the victim has suffered a two-wheeler/motorcycle accident, and is wearing a helmet, !!\\nthen do not attempt to remove the helmet. You may open the wind shield of the helmet \\nwithout disturbing the placement.

If the bleeding is at the site of the neck, it is possible that it could \\ncause blocking in the airway. \\nWash your hands before you attempt to stop bleeding in a person.!!\\nApply pressure on the site of bleeding using a clean cloth. Use the material that you !!\\nalready have and not waste time in searching for proper dressing material. Make sure that \\nthe cloth you use is clean. \\nPress on the wound for at least 10 minutes to give the blood time to clot.!!\\nOnce you are holding pressure on the bleeding site, do not remove the pressure to check !!\\nif the bleeding has stopped. It may be useful to make the victim lie down on \\n!!\\ntheir back and raising the injured part above \\nthe level of the victim’s chest. This will help in \\nreducing the flow of blood. \\nIf the bleeding does not stop with pressure then !!\\nbandage the injured part with a cloth firmly (but \\nnot very tightly as it might restrict the circulation and make the arm/leg turn blue). If bleeding \\nstrikes through the dressing, bandage another \\nfirmly over the top.\\nIf bleeding or injury is severe, raise the feet and \\n!!\\nlower the head to prevent shock.Do not use a tourniquet. It can make the bleeding worse, and may result in tissue damage \\n!!\\nand even gangrene.Remember to also protect yourself from infection. If you have any open wound on your \\n!!\\nskin, first cover the wound before helping the victim. \\nControl of excessive bleeding\\n1. Raise the injured part\\n2. Apply pressure on the wound directly by tying a clean cloth/bandage 3. Hold the pressure4. Tie the bleeding site with a bandage firmly but not very tightly.5. Hold this pressure until help arrives. \\n3.1.3. Safe Referral/Transport\\nAs you have been taught before, you should call for help as soon as you recognise a life-\\nthreatening situation. You need to know the public health facilities nearest to you which provide \\ncare for trauma and accident related emergencies. Mapping of all the nearest referral centres \\nshould be done and information should be kept handy regarding facilities: \\ni. Which can provide primary care for emergencies like superficial bleeding wounds etc.\\nii.

Iron box, heater, etc.\\n4.\\tKeep small children away from electric appliances, plug points, etc.\\n5.\\tDo not go near electric grids or live wires.\\nLightening Injuries: \\nAs you may have seen, lightening is the electric discharge that happens during thunderstorms. In \\nsome cases, this can be very dangerous when the lightening comes in contact with the body. In \\nmost situations, lightning often travels over the skin rather than through the body and hence, most \\nvictims of lightening injuries survive. The most common immediate effect of lightening injuries is on the respiratory system of the body which can cause cardiac arrest leading to death. \\nHow to recognise life threatening situations pertaining to lightening injuries?\\nYou should treat every case of lightening injury as immediate and refer to the nearest appropriate \\nfacility as soon as possible. However, there are some signs that you can look for in the victim to understand the severity and provide stabilization.\\nLoss of consciousness \\n!!\\nLoss of memory!!\\nConfusion !!\\nA feathering or fern shaped burn on the skin (This is not !!\\nvery common, but whenever present, is a classical sign of lightening injury). \\nAll of the above signs you will be able to see in the victim, when you check for AVPU and follow ABCDE protocol.\\nPreventing lightening injuries:\\nEven though lightening injuries are dangerous, it is largely possible to prevent getting struck by lightning. The following key messages can be used for awareness generation in the community \\nto avoid injuries related to lightening:\\n1. Prevention of indoor lightening casualties:\\nEven though houses provide safe shelter during a lightning storm, you may still be at risk. \\n!!\\nIt is a myth that lightening injuries cannot be caused indoors. \\nAvoid water!!  Do NOT bathe, shower, wash dishes, or have any other contact with water \\nduring a thunderstorm because lightning can travel through a housing plumbing vent.\\nAvoid electronic equipment!!  Do NOT use your computers, laptops, game systems, \\nwashers, dryers, stoves, or anything connected to an electrical outlet. Lightning can travel \\nthrough electrical systems, radio and television reception systems, and any metal wires \\nor bars in concrete walls or flooring. \\nAvoid windows, doors, porches, and concrete!!  Do NOT lie on concrete floors during a \\nthunderstorm. Also, avoid leaning on concrete walls. Lightning can travel through any \\nmetal wires or bars in concrete walls or flooring. \\n2. Prevention of outdoor lightening casualties:\\nBe aware !!\\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_19': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 19 If aware about thunderstorms predictions, postpone outdoor activities, or make sure !!\\nadequate safe shelter is readily available.\\nGo indoors!!  Remember the phrase, “When thunder roars, go indoors.” Find a safe, \\nenclosed shelter when you hear thunder. Safe shelters include homes, offices, shopping \\ncentres, and hard-top vehicles with the windows rolled up.\\nSeek shelter immediately even if caught out in the open !! If you are caught in an open \\narea, act quickly to find adequate shelter. The most important action is to remove yourself \\nfrom danger. \\nRemember:\\nCrouching or getting low to the ground can reduce your chances of being struck, but does \\nnot remove you from danger.\\nIf one is caught outside with no safe shelter nearby, the following actions may reduce their risk:\\nImmediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges, or peaks.!!\\nNever lie flat on the ground. Crouch down in a ball-like position with your head tucked !!\\nand hands over the ears so that they are down low with minimal contact with the ground. \\nNever shelter under an isolated tree.\\n!!\\nNever use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter.!!\\nImmediately get out of and away from ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water.!!\\nStay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, !!\\netc.).Separate\\n!!  If one is in a group during a thunderstorm, separate from each other. This will \\nreduce the number of injuries if lightning strikes the ground.\\nDO NOT do the following: \\nDo not stay in open vehicles, structures, and spaces!!  during a thunderstorm, avoid open \\nvehicles such as motorcycles. Be sure to avoid open structures such as playgrounds.Do not stay near tall structures\\n!!  Do NOT lie on concrete floors during a thunderstorm. \\nAlso, avoid leaning on concrete walls. \\n3.3. Bites (Animal bite/snake bite/scorpion sting/other insect bites)\\n3.3.1. Recognizing life threatening situations\\nIrrespective of the nature of the bite, i.e. even if you feel that the victim’s condition does not \\nappear serious, you should refer the case to the nearest health facility since symptoms could \\nhave delayed occurrence and shall need observation to understand the fatality of the situation. \\nHowever, sometimes an animal bite or sting could present with obvious signs as follows which \\nrequire immediate care:\\nSymptoms that are not just at the site of the bite or sting!!\\nIf the bite appears infected (redness with or without pus, warmth, fever, or a red streak !!\\nthat spreads toward the body)', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_20': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres20 An open or ulcerated bite wound could be suggestive of a scorpion bite!!\\nWheezing!!\\nShortness of breath!!\\nChest pain or tightness!!\\nSensation of the throat closing or difficulty speaking or swallowing!!\\nFaintness or weakness!!\\n3.3.2. Management Protocol\\nSpecific Measures\\nAnimal bites and scratches are commonly seen in both adults and children. Animal bites (dog, \\ncat, monkey, and domestic animals like cow or horse, wild animals) may cause a deadly disease \\ncalled rabies, if bitten by an infected animal. Rabies is caused by a virus which is present in the \\nsaliva of infected animals which can spread through bites or licks on broken skin. In case of animal bites, the following steps must be followed:\\n1. Wash the wound immediately with soap and running water for at least 10 minutes.\\n2. Reassure the victim.\\n3. Control any bleeding from the site of bite. Apply pressure but not too tightly since it can speed up the spread of virus.\\n4. Refer the victim immediately to a health facility for proper management and vaccination.\\nCaution:\\nDo not apply turmeric powder, chili powder, limestone, paste of leaves or plants on the !!\\nbite wound. \\nDo not place coins, bark of trees or any other object on the bite wound.!!\\nDo not cut the wound open.!!\\nIn case of a dog bite, you should ask the victim or their relatives/family to observe the dog !!\\nfor 10 days to see if there are any behavioral changes in the dog. \\nSnake bite:\\nIn case of snake bite, use the RIGHT approach.\\nR: Reassure the person (70% of snakebites: from non- poisonous snakes only 50% poisonous \\nsnakes inject poison).\\nI: Immobilize the affected body part of the victim.\\nGH: Get to the Hospital immediately.T: Tell the doctor at the referred facility about presence of any symptoms (Pain, weakness, \\nbleeding, etc.).\\nCaution:\\nDo not tie a tourniquet in cases of snake bite.!!', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_21': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 21 Snake venom does not spread through blood.!!\\nDo not try to suck out poison from snake bite, or cut the wound open.!!\\nDo not make the victim move too much.!!\\nIn most cases, if the snake has been killed, it should be taken to the hospital along with !!\\nthe patient to make sure the treatment is right BUT DO NOT waste time in searching for \\nthe snake. It could lead to more casualty if the snake is not dead and only injured. \\nScorpion sting/other insect bites:\\nIn case of scorpion sting or other suspected poisonous insect bite, wash the wound immediately \\nwith soap and water and refer the victim to the nearest health facility.\\n3.3.3.

Do not unnecessarily go near animals. Teach children to not harm animals and be careful \\nif they play with animals. Do not leave small children unattended outside the house.\\n2. Stay alert and wear adequate protective clothes, shoes, etc. to prevent snake and scorpion \\nbites while going to the field or other areas.\\n3. For farmers and people working in forests or fields – Always wear protective gear while going for work.\\n4.\\tMake adequate safety provisions to prevent snakes, scorpions, other insects and animals from entering the house.\\n3.4. Pregnancy related emergencies\\n3.4.1. Recognizing life threatening situations\\nIt is important to understand that pregnant women are not only vulnerable to pregnancy related emergencies but could also be a victim of trauma/accident or any of the other emergency \\nconditions. Hence, when you are attending to a distressed pregnant woman, always consider it \\nan emergency. The following are signs of emergency:\\nAny bleeding from the vagina:\\n!!\\nHeavy bleeding with severe stomach pain in the first three months of pregnancy!\\x83\\nHeavy bleeding with cramping in the !\\x83\\nfirst three to four months of pregnancy \\nBleeding with abdominal pain in the !\\x83\\nlast three months of pregnancy\\nSevere bleeding within the first few !\\x83\\ndays after delivery\\nHeadache and blurred vision!!\\nDizziness, loss of consciousness or fits!!\\nSevere vomiting !!\\nSevere pain in the abdomen !!\\nSudden and significant swelling of hands, !!\\nface and feet \\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_23': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 23 Regular, increasingly intense contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy !!\\n3.4.2. Management Protocol \\n(a) General Measures to be undertaken in pregnancy related emergencies remain the same as \\nyou have learnt in previous sections.\\n(b) Specific Measures\\nThe first principles of dealing with pregnancy related emergencies are the same as for any \\nemergency (see to the airway, breathing, and circulation). Eclampsia (headache, blurred vision, \\nfits), antepartum haemorrhage (vaginal bleeding during pregnancy), postpartum haemorrhage \\n(vaginal bleeding few days after delivery), ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be treated as emergencies and help should be called for as soon as possible. However, until help arrives, there \\nare certain measures that you can take to stabilize the woman.\\n1. Eclampsia\\nIf a pregnant woman presents with sudden headache, blurred vision and fits, provide basic first \\naid as you would in other cases of fits. Remember that the focus should be on keeping the airway clear of any obstructions, and seeing to it that the woman is able to breathe properly. The \\nmeasures to take during fits include:\\nDo not leave the woman unattended and keep surrounding safe to avoid any maternal \\n!!\\ninjuries due to fits (eg. keeping pillows to avoid injury from surrounding objects, remove \\nany objects in the way that can injure the woman further).\\nPlacing a clean cloth between the teeth of the woman so that she does not bite the !!\\ntongue. If the biting or jittering of the teeth is vigorous, do not attempt this since it could \\nhurt your fingers. \\nPlacing her in recovery position after the fits stop.!!\\nCaution: \\nDo not attempt to hold the woman’s mouth open.!!\\nDo not hold the woman down or try to stop her movements or restrain her arms/legs tightly.!!\\nDo not offer the woman water or food until she is fully alert.!!\\nAntepartum Haemorrhage:\\nIf a pregnant woman presents with vaginal bleeding, immediately call the ambulance and refer \\nher to the nearest health facility where a gynaecologist is available. \\nPost-Partum Haemorrhage: \\n1. Uterine massage can help control the bleeding and should be done until bleeding is visibly less. Rub the uterus gently from outside immediately to keep the uterus well-contracted.\\n2. Encouraging the woman to empty her bladder. If she cannot urinate on her own, help her by trickling warm water over her abdomen.\\n3. Maintain the woman’s body warmth by covering with blanket.\\n4. Position the woman by making her lay flat, rising her legs to maintain blood pressure.\\n5. Keep the woman emotionally supported, and keep her calm.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_24': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres24 Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy\\nAn ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which a fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus, \\nmost commonly the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies usually do not reach term, and rupture \\naround 10-12 weeks causing severe internal bleeding which may lead to shock and present as \\nan emergency.\\nIn many cases of ectopic pregnancy, the first presentation may be after it has ruptured and the \\nwoman might not even know she was pregnant. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy always requires \\nsurgical intervention. Any of the following symptoms and signs warrant an emergency situation and immediate stabilization and referral to a specialist should be sought. \\nSudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain\\n!!\\nDizziness or fainting!!\\nPain in the lower back!!\\nPain in the shoulders (due to leakage of blood into the abdomen affecting the !!\\ndiaphragm)\\nCold clammy skin, rapid thready pulse indicating hypovolemic shock!!\\nIn every case involving the above symptoms in a pregnant woman, you should suspect ruptured \\nectopic pregnancy and refer to the Community Health Centre (CHC) or District Hospital (DH), \\nwhichever is nearer, by first informing the Community Health Officer (CHO).\\n3.4.3. Safe Transport and Referral\\nRefer section 3.1.3 as well as annexure II. \\n3.4.4. Follow-up Care\\nMost cases of pregnancy related emergencies do not require extensive care after discharge \\nfrom the health facility, for complete recovery. However, they do require follow-up care to check \\nfor any post-discharge complications like bleeding, loose stitches, infections etc. as well as the \\nwoman might be in need of emotional support. As the ASHA, you will be involved in checking for such complications during HBNC visits and informing the ANM/MPW-F for any suspected/reported complication. Your role will be to provide follow-up care and providing support to the \\nwoman and her family whenever required.  \\n3.5. New-born Emergencies \\n3.5.1 Recognising life threatening situations\\nIn a new-born or infant, the following are the signs of emergency:\\nAbnormally high or low body temperature!!\\nDrowsy, lethargic or unconscious!!\\nNot being able to feed or vomiting everything!!\\nConvulsions !!\\nGrunting and severe chest in-drawing!!\\nFast breathing!!', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_25': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 25 3.5.2. Management Protocol\\nSpecific Measures\\nIn any type of new born emergencies, you should carry out ABCDE protocol, provide first-aid \\nwherever possible and then the child should be referred to a facility where the presenting \\ncondition can be treated (Refer Annexure-II)\\nThe most common newborn emergencies are collectively called “THE MISFITS”\\nT: Toxicity\\nH: Heart disease\\nE: Endocrine \\nM: Metabolic (electrolyte imbalance) I: Inborn errors of Metabolism\\nS: SepsisF: Formula Mishaps\\nI: Intestinal problemsT: Trauma \\nS: Seizu\\nres\\n3.5.3.

Follow up care\\nLike you have already learnt in previous sections on follow up care, even infants who have suffered \\nemergency situations could need follow-up care in order to make sure there is no complications. \\nIn such cases, you should educate the parents or guardians of the infant regarding wound care \\nand report any complication to the ANM/CHO. \\n3.5.5. Prevention at community level\\nNewborn emergencies could be any of the emergency conditions ranging from poisoning, burns, choking, drowning, acute abdomen, trauma, bites etc. that can be prevented by being aware and \\ntaking specific precautions against them. You will play an important role in raising awareness among \\ncommunity members about these emergencies and educating them regarding their prevention by targeting parents during immunization days, Village Health Nutrition Days (VHNDs) etc. \\n3.6. Heart Attack, Stroke, Diabetic Emergencies\\n3.6.1. Recognising life threatening situations\\nSome of the general signs that can be considered life threatening are:\\nSudden weakness in arms or legs (usually affects one side of the body)!!\\nSudden drooping or weakness in one side of face!!\\nSudden loss of balance, headache, dizziness or loss of consciousness!!', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_26': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres26 Sudden blurring of vision!!\\nSudden difficulty in speech/inability to speak!!\\nSudden pain in the chest !!\\nLow Blood Sugar Level High Blood Sugar Level\\n1.

Management Protocol \\n(a) General Measures \\nThe general measures for management and prompt stabilization of emergency conditions arising out of NCDs is similar to the one you have learnt in the beginning of the chapter with \\nthe following exception.\\nThe sequence of ABCDE protocol is different for cases suggestive of cardiac emergencies. When \\nyou are attending to a victim of cardiac emergency like cardiac arrest, the most important step \\nis to allow blood to be pumped by the heart and hence, the suggested protocol for cardiac \\nemergencies is CAB instead of (H) ABCDE/ABCDE. \\nIn addition to this, you should follow the rest of the protocols under general measures that you \\nhave learnt. \\n(b) Specific Measures\\nAs you have learnt earlier, the two most common NCDs – hypertension and diabetes – can lead to emergencies if not controlled. You have been trained about these complications in the module \\non non-communicable diseases. The following emergency conditions can arise as complications \\nof uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes.\\nIn NCD related emergency conditions, the most important step you must take is planning a \\nproper referral. Apart from that, sometimes when you find no pulse, you will be needed to perform CPR (Annexure-I).\\nStroke \\nIt is characterized by:\\nSudden weakness in arms or legs (usually affects one side of the body)!!\\nSudden drooping or weakness in one side of face!!\\nSudden loss of balance, headache, dizziness or loss of consciousness!!\\nSudden blurring of vision!!\\nSudden difficulty in speech/inability to speak!!', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_27': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 27 A case of stroke must be immediately transferred to a tertiary care hospital.\\nHeart attack/cardiac arrest\\nIt is characterized by sudden pain in the chest which may spread to left arm, difficulty in breathing \\nand loss of consciousness. Sometimes a heart attack may present only as sweating, nausea, \\ntiredness, tingling and numbness in the extremities.\\nA case of heart attack, the victim must immediately be taken to the nearest health facility. They \\nmay require Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (Remember to follow CAB and not ABC). See \\nAnnexure I for procedure of CPR.\\nDiabetic emergencies: High and low sugar in the body\\nPatients with diabetes have high blood \\nsugar levels because of the body’s \\ninability to utilize the glucose. Diabetic \\npatients follow a low sugar diet and take medicines which help the glucose to get utilized and thus keeps the blood sugar \\nlevels in check.\\nDiabetic emergencies arise in two \\nsituations:\\n1.\\tWhen the disease is uncontrolled (the patient does not follow \\nlow sugar diet or does not take \\nmedicines) it leads to very high \\nblood sugar level.\\n2.\\tWhen the patient on diabetes medicine does not eat for a long time, it leads to very low blood \\nsugar level.\\nThe symptoms of high and low blood sugar levels have been given in the table in section 3.6.1. \\nIf a person who has a known history of diabetes shows any of these symptoms, refer him/her \\nimmediately to the nearest appropriate health facility.\\n3.6.3. Safe transport and Referral \\n(Refer to section 3.1.3)\\n3.6.4. Follow-up Care\\nIn cases of NCD related emergencies, the follow-up care would consist of ensuring regular \\ncheck-ups of the patient as well as educating him/her regarding strict adherence to dietary and \\nlifestyle modification advice and medications, which you along with the ANM and CHO have \\nalready been doing.\\n3.6.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level\\nYou have already been involved in generating community level awareness regarding NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, cancer etc. In addition to the work you have already been doing, you \\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_28': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres28 could also consider the following key messages in order to prevent emergencies related to \\nNCDs (hypertension and diabetes):\\n1.\\tAll hypertensive and diabetic patients should get their blood pressure and blood sugar checked regularly, take medicines as prescribed, follow dietary advice, maintain healthy lifestyle and visit the doctor regularly. \\n2.\\tPregnant women with hypertension and other co-morbidities should undergo periodic monitoring of their vitals and keep family and you informed.\\n3.7. Exposure Illnesses\\n3.7.1. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke\\nAs you are aware, India is a country of high humidity (especially in the southern coastal area) and extreme temperatures (summers in the northern states). In such conditions, heat illnesses \\nare common considering long hours spent in harsh sun. Prolonged time in the sun could lead \\nto dehydration (loss of water from the body) which could further cause or trigger heat illnesses. In the following section, you shall learn about the two most common heat illnesses namely heat exhaustion and heat stroke and how to help the victims of these illnesses.\\nWhat is heat exhaustion?\\nHeat exhaustion is basically a warning that the body is getting too hot. The body on touch will feel cold and clammy because the temperature of body as well as the pulse is normal in such \\ncases. Exhaustion in simple terms means “getting tired”. Similarly, in heat exhaustion, the body is \\ntired because of loss of water and salt from the body due to excessive sweating. Although heat illnesses can happen with anyone, it is more seen in elderly people. \\nWhat is Heat Stroke?\\nIf heat exhaustion is left untreated, it could lead to more severe symptoms causing a ‘heat stroke’. This is the most serious heat illness and is caused by body temperature rising to 104 F (40 C) or \\nhigher. A heat stroke would need immediate medical attention and without any delay you should \\ntransport the victim to the nearest appropriate facility since untreated heatstroke can quickly damage their brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. The degree of damage that a heat stroke can \\ncause will depend on the height of body temperature and the amount of time spent in the sun. \\n3.7.1.1. Recognising life threatening situations\\nEmergency conditions due to heat illnesses are common especially in extreme climatic regions. These are illnesses that occur due to prolonged exposure to high heat conditions. The symptoms \\nof heat exhaustion and heat stroke are given in the table below:\\nHeat exhaustion Heat stroke\\n1. Dizziness or fainting\\n2. Excessive sweating3. Cool, pale and clammy skin4. Rapid and weak pulse5. Nausea or vomiting6. Muscle cramps1. Headache2. No sweating3. Red, hot and dry skin (feels like fever)4. Rapid but strong pulse5. Nausea or vomiting6. May lose consciousness', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_29': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 29 3.7.1.2. Management Protocol \\nSpecific Measures\\nIn a case of heat exhaustion, assure the following:\\n1. Get the person to lie down in a cool place in the shade.\\n2. Loosen his/her clothing. \\n3. Apply cool, wet cloth on the forehead, neck, arms and other exposed areas of the body. \\n4. Fan the person with cool air. \\n5. Give sips of water slowly.\\n6. If vomiting occurs, refer immediately to the nearest health facility.\\nIn a case of heat stroke, assure the following:\\n1. Start cool bath or sponging to reduce body temperature. Use extreme caution.\\n2. Start rapid cooling until body temperature reaches 38°C (100.4°F). External cooling is most \\neffective. Place patient on a cooling surface, wet the victim’s skin and dry with fan to \\noptimize evaporative cooling, and place ice packs to the neck,  Cold water immersion is \\neffective, but not practical. (Commonly used cooling techniques are given below).\\n3. Do not give fluids orally if the person is not conscious.\\n4. If the victim starts having fits (seizures), follow the stabilization protocol as learnt in \\nsection 3.9.2. \\nExternal cooling \\nWhat is external cooling?\\nIt is a method that involves application of a cooling media (like cold water, ice, fanning etc.) to \\nthe skin, which causes removal of heat, usually resulting in a lower temperature. This type of \\ncooling is important in extreme cases of heat illnesses. Some of the most commonly used cooling \\ntechniques are as follows:\\n1.  Evaporative cooling: In very simple words, this means using air to cause cooling to the victim. \\nThis is very similar to how we use a \\nhand fan in summers. You can use any object that is available at the \\nsite to cause this. Most commonly \\nused objects could be a magazine, papers, cloth like dupatta etc. this is one of the most acceptable and \\nreadily available techniques for \\ncooling and is also well tolerated by victims. (Remember, in case of a heat \\nstroke, the victim shall not be seen \\nsweating. In this case, you should first wet the victim’s skin by splashing some water on the victim’s face and \\nbody and then using a hand held fan \\netc. to cause evaporative cooling) \\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_30': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres30 2.  Immersive cooling: This is also a simple technique, however, it might not always be possible \\nbecause you will need a water source, a bucket like vessel to hold the cold water etc. In cases \\nwhere you have access to these materials, you can use this technique as it is also proven to \\nbe effective. The following steps are to be followed for conducting immersive technique:\\nFill a vessel (a bucket preferably) with ice-cold water.!!\\nDip the victim’s hands/ feet in the bucket !!\\nYou can also dip a cloth in this water and put it on the forehead of the victim like is !!\\ntraditionally done during fever. More frequent ice pack/cloth change and reapplication of cold water will allow for more rapid cooling. \\n3.7.2. Cold exposure related illnesses (Hypothermia and Frostbite) \\nSimilar to heat related illnesses, some parts of the Indian terrain are also prone to cold exposure related illnesses especially in the Himalayan regions, Ladakh, Siachen, Leh, owing to extreme \\ncold weather. You might have come across cases where a thumb or a toe goes numb after a long exposure to extreme cold. Any such cases should always be treated as a medical emergency. \\nWhat is hypothermia? \\nHypothermia is a sharp fall in the body temperature, caused by prolonged exposures to very cold temperatures. The body’s temperature drops below 95° F (35° C) against a normal body \\ntemperature of 98.6° F (37° C). When the body temperature is dangerously low, the brain and \\nbody cannot function properly and hence it should always be treated as an emergency. \\nWhat is frostbite?\\nFrostbite is different from hypothermia in the sense that it is more localised. It affects the body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. Hypothermia \\naffects the whole body.  A person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have hypothermia \\nFrostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The anatomic sites most susceptible to frostbite \\ninclude hands, feet, and exposed tissues (eg, ears, nose, and lips).\\nHow is hypothermia different from frostbite?\\nFrostbite affects the body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to \\ncold weather while hypothermia affects the whole body. A person with frostbite on the arms or legs \\nmay also have hypothermia due to loss of body heat, causing lowering of body temperature. \\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_31': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 31 3.7.2.1. Recognising life threatening situations\\nHypothermia Frostbite \\nAdults: \\nShiveringExhaustion\\nConfusionRedness or pain in any skin area may be the first sign \\nof frostbite\\nA white or grayish-yellow skin area\\nFumbling handsMemory loss Slurred speech DrowsinessInfants: Bright red, cold skinVery low energySkin that feels unusually firm or waxyNumbness- victim unable to feel the affected area\\n3.7.2.2. Management protocol \\nSpecific Measures\\nIn a case of cold exposure related illnesses, \\n1. Move the victim away from the cold exposure to a warm room or shelter. \\n2. You could use hot water bags/ bottles to help warm the affected area. \\n3. Do not use electric warmers or other dry heating sources as these could cause burns. \\n4. Do not rub or make the victim walk or use the affected body part.\\n5. If there are blisters, be careful to not break them or let the victim break them.\\n6. Remove any wet clothing the victim is wearing.\\n7. If the victim is conscious and alert, you could offer warm fluids like tea, warm milk or high \\nenergy food like chocolate etc.\\n8. Keep the body dried and wrapped, including their head and neck, in a warm blanket.\\n9. If the victim is unresponsive, on assessment, he/she may be in need of CPR or assisted \\nbreathing.\\nNote:\\nIf you are comfortable and willing, you could use skin-to-skin contact where your own body \\nheat can be used to warm the victim, in cases where you are not able to find a hot water bottle/\\nbag or blankets,\\nCaution: A victim of frostbite could often be unaware due to numbness in the skin of the affected body part. In such situations, the victim could be prone to self-harm. While stabilizing, you should \\nbe careful not to allow the victim to rub, scratch or massage the affected area\\n3.7.3. Safe transport and referral\\nReferral and transport is especially of prime importance if it is a case of exposure related illnesses. In such cases, you should plan a referral to the nearest appropriate health facility by keeping the \\nCHO informed.', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_32': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres32 3.7.4. Follow-up Care\\nExposure related illnesses are mostly controlled with general measures or once treatment is \\ncompleted and do not require follow up care for recovery. However, each case is different and if \\nthe MO or the CHO who treated the patient prescribes follow-up care (either due to any injuries \\nor underlying disorder), you as the ASHA should help the patient maintain treatment compliance and aid in the patient’s recovery. \\n3.7.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at Community Level\\nGenerally exposure related illnesses are self-limiting and are largely preventable. The following precautionary measures can be used by you to create awareness in the community regarding \\nthe same. \\nFor heat related illnesses: \\n1. Wear loose fitting, light colored clothes in summer. Always keep head covered when \\ngoing out in the sun.\\n2. Avoid direct sun heat (especially during afternoon).\\n3. Rest in shaded places. For occupations which require working outdoors, take frequent breaks. \\n4. Avoid vigorous physical activities in hot and humid weather. \\n5. Drink plenty of fluids and water to stay hydrated during hot weather.\\nFor cold exposure illnesses:\\n1. Wear woolen/warm multilayer clothing in winters or in areas with cold climate, adequately \\ncovering the extremities like feet, hands, chin, and ears. \\n2. Avoid long and direct exposure to extreme cold like snow, waterbodies etc\\n3. Consumption of locally available foods that help in warming up the body like peanuts, ghee etc. \\n4. Exercising or regular physical activity help warm up the body.\\n3.8. Severe Allergic Reactions\\n3.8.1. Recognizing life threatening situations\\nEven though allergies are common, sometimes, allergic \\nreactions may be life-threatening. Severe allergic \\nreactions can be of two types. The warning signs are \\nas follows:  \\nIn the first type, there is swelling of the lips, !!\\ntongue, face and throat which can lead to wheezing and difficulty in breathing. Sometimes \\nswelling may also appear in the genitals, hands, \\nand feet.\\nIn the second type, the blood pressure falls \\n!!\\ndrastically leading to shock with symptoms like \\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_33': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 33 dizziness and fainting, mental confusion, weak and rapid pulse, cold and clammy skin, \\nnausea and vomiting.\\nSometimes mild allergic reactions may progress to severe allergy. Therefore it is also important to be cautious of mild allergic symptoms such as: \\nSneezing, itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth, stuffy nose, watery, red or \\n!!\\nswollen eyes.\\nTingling sensation in the mouth particularly due to food allergens.!!\\nSevere itching or hives (red, very itchy, smoothly elevated areas of skin) all over the !!\\nbody.\\n3.8.2. Management Protocol \\nSpecific Measures\\nThe treatment for allergies is divided into two parts: History Taking and Symptomatic Treatment\\nHistory taking:\\nIf the person is able to speak, a history of what caused the allergy should be taken so that it can \\nbe avoided in future. If the person is not able to speak, ask anyone who was there with him/her \\nat the time the allergy began. You could ask if the cause of the allergy is any of the allergens \\nmentioned in 3.8.5 that the patient might have come in contact with. If not, you should ask about \\nany other substance that the patient could have been exposed to for the first time. If the person \\nhas had allergic reactions before, ask the person about what had caused it the previous time.\\nSymptomatic Treatment:\\nMost of the times, you will see that the person suffering from such an allergic reaction will have symptoms as we learnt in the previous chapter. Proper and timely first aid can help the patient \\nfrom progressing into a dangerous anaphylactic shock. Sometimes, minor redness or itching can \\nturn into a severe reaction within minutes and hence should not be ignored. \\nIn such situations, first call for help and inform the nearest appropriate public health facility as well \\nas the CHO about their readiness to attend to the case. To stabilize the patient till help arrives:\\n1. Lay the patient flat with legs raised\\n2. Reassure the patient\\n3. Loosen any tight clothing \\n4. Apply a cool, damp cloth on the hives, if present, to soothe the itching\\n5. Move the patient to the shade since heat could worsen the symptoms\\nCaution:\\nDo not allow the patient to stand or walk!!\\nDo not place them in seated, standing, or upright position!!\\nDo not give any other medicine!!\\nDo not give any food or water to the patient if he/she is breathless or unconscious!!', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_34': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres34 3.8.3. Safe transport and Referral\\nIf you recognise the situation of the patient to be life-threatening based on the presenting \\nsymptoms, you should first call for help and inform the nearest appropriate public health facility \\nas well as the CHO about their readiness to attend to the case.\\nRefer section 3.1.4.\\n3.8.4. Follow up Care\\nFollow up care is of importance when it comes to patients who have had an allergic reaction \\nearlier. The care that the patient will need post treatment is not related to treatment, but it is \\nactually to prevent further incidences as this one. \\nIn case of Anaphylaxis/Severe Allergic Reactions, you could help the person identify the allergen \\n(substance that caused the allergy) through a thorough history taking, and educate him/her to \\navoid the identified allergen from then onwards. This information can also come handy in case \\nthe situation repeats.  \\n3.8.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level\\nAn Allergy is a condition where our body reacts to a foreign substance in the body which could either be inhaled or ingested. This reaction usually causes symptoms in the nose, throat, ears, \\nskin and stomach. An allergic reaction usually starts within a few minutes. Some of these foreign substances include but is not limited to the following:\\nAirborne allergens \\n!! such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mould\\nCertain food !! particularly peanuts, wheat, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk\\nInsect stings !! such as from a bee or wasp\\nMedications !! particularly penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics\\nLatex or other substances you touch !! which can cause allergic skin reactions\\nWhat could cause allergy in one person may not cause allergy in another, in the sense that \\nallergens could be unique to individuals and hence it is difficult to identify the allergen unless the \\nindividual is exposed to it. This is why history taking is extremely important. \\n3.9. Seizures/Fits \\n3.9.1. Recognising life threatening situations \\nFits (convulsions/seizures) can occur due to many underlying medical causes, in both adults and children. In case of a person suffering from fits, assure the following:\\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_35': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 35 Identify whether the fits are affecting the entire body (Generalized) or some parts (Focal)\\na. Generalized fits involves shaking of the whole body (the person is on the floor and \\nvigorously shaking, he/she may appear confused or may lose consciousness).\\nb. Focal fits involves only some parts of the body (the person may have repetitive movements like chewing/blinking or rhythmic twitching of any body part.\\n3.9.2. Management Protocol \\nIf the patient before you is having fits, you should not do anything that restricts their movements. However, you should make sure that they do not hurt themselves during the \\nfits episode due to any obstacles in the way. You can follow the below mentioned steps to \\nensure the same: \\n1. Keep surrounding safe (eg. keep pillows to avoid injury from surrounding objects, remove \\nany objects in the way that can injure the patient further).\\n2. Place a clean cloth between the teeth of the patient so that he/she does not bite the tongue.\\n3. Place patient in recovery position after the fits stop.\\nCaution \\nDo not attempt to hold the person’s mouth open.!!\\nDo not hold the person down or try to stop his/her movements or restrain his/her arms/!!\\nlegs tightly\\nDo not offer the person water or food until he/she is fully alert.!!\\n3.9.3. Safe transport and Referral \\nAs you learnt in the management protocol, you should never restrict the movements of the \\nperson who is having fits. Hence, you should also not move or transport the person while the \\nperson is having seizures. Call for help as soon as you attend the patient and keep CHO informed \\nabout the referral. A person experiencing a seizures, needs to be referred to a facility that has availability of a CT scan. \\nRemember that you should move or transport the patient only when the person has stopped \\nseizures and movements are stable. \\n3.9.4. Follow up Care\\nPatients of epilepsy or fits generally require long-term follow-up care especially if the root cause of the epilepsy has not yet been diagnosed. For this, a thorough history taking is extremely \\nimportant followed by investigations. Hence, when you attend to a patient who is having fits, you \\nshould be very observant as it will help in a proper history and diagnosis.\\nOnce the diagnosis has been established, the patient might require help in terms of treatment \\ncompliance, side effects of the treatment medications etc which you could help with during home \\nvisits. You could also undertake educating the family regarding the condition so that the patient receives the necessary support. You should also make sure that the patient as well as the family is aware of the specifications of the disorder, the medications, the possible side-effects with the \\nmedication, recurrence etc. ', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_36': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres36 Any recurring episode needs to be reported to the CHO so that appropriate treatment can be \\ndone. In case the person develops permanent disability, ensure that he/she receives appropriate \\npalliative care. Link him/her with the palliative care services provided through the AB-HWC and \\nprovide psycho-social support to help the person overcome the crisis.\\n5.9.5. Prevention and awareness Generation at the Community Level\\nLack of awareness regarding epilepsy or seizures at the community level acts as a barrier in providing treatment and care in the community. Not all seizures are preventable but seizures \\nthat occur as a result of trauma from accidents, stroke or other heart diseases, infections, and \\nmaternity related events can be prevented to certain extent. You as the ASHA, could make the community aware regarding the causes of epilepsy that are preventable as well as about the treatment options available.\\nSome key messages that you can make use of in the community are\\nEncouraging immunization for every individual in the community (so as to protect the \\n!!\\ncommunity from preventable infections)\\nEnsuring pregnant women to receive proper ANC!!\\nGenerating awareness regarding safety measures to avoid head injuries!!\\nPromoting healthy lifestyle in order to avoid stroke and other heart diseases.!!\\n5.10. Choking\\nEven though choking is more common in children, it can also happen in adults. The object on \\nwhich the victim has choked, might block the throat. In such cases, the victim might have difficulty \\nin breathing or talking and sometimes the skin might turn blue. \\n5.10.1. Recognizing life threatening situations\\nIn some cases, choking can be life-threatening since the object the victim is choking on could \\ncut off airway giving the brain limited oxygen. The brain can only function without oxygen for few \\nminutes and this is why it is important to attend to the victim of choking as soon as possible. A \\nperson who’s choking may cough continuously until they expel the food or liquid from their throat or airway. However, in some cases, the object, food, or liquid gets stuck in the throat and cuts off the air supply. Some of the signs to identify if the case is life-threatening and needs emergency \\ncare are following:\\nThe victim is unable to speak, cough, make noise or breathe\\n!!\\nBluish tint to the lips, skin, or nails from a lack of oxygen!!\\n5.10.2. Management Protocol\\nSpecific Measures: \\nThe object on which the victim has choked, might block the throat. In such cases, the victim might \\nhave difficulty in breathing or talking and sometimes the skin might turn blue. \\nThe tables given below shows how to manage a case of choking. Either technique can be used.\\nFor an adult:', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_37': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 37 Step 1 Reassure the person.\\nStep 2 Bend him/her forwards so that the head is lower than the chest.\\nStep 3 Encourage him/her to cough if possible.\\nStep 4 Give up to five sharp blows on the back \\nbetween shoulder blades with the flat of your hands. When to slap back when to compress the bell?\\nOR\\nStep 1 Stand behind the victim and \\nput both arms round the upper part of his/her abdomen. If the choking patient is a child, position yourself to the correct height. If the choking patient is a pregnant woman, place your arms below the chest and above the level of the abdomen.\\nStep 2 Lean the victim forward.\\nStep 3 Clench your fist and place it between the umbilicus (navel) and the bottom of \\nsternum (breast bone).\\nStep 4 Grasp this hand with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards.\\nStep 5 Repeat up to five times.\\nFor a small child: \\nStep 1 Place the child over your knee\\n', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_38': 'Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  \\nat Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres38 Step 2 Slap him on the back between shoulder blades using less force than for \\nan adult. Use the heel of one hand to give up to 5 back slaps between the baby’s shoulder blades.\\nFor a baby:\\nStep 1 Lay the baby along your forearm\\nStep 2 Slap him on the back between shoulder blades using less force than for a child. \\nUse the heel of one hand to give up to 5 back slaps between the baby’s shoulder blades.\\nNote: If the choking patient is unconscious, do not attempt these techniques. Look for and \\nremove the foreign body ONLY if it is visible. Refer to the hospital immediately.\\n3.10.3. Safe transport and Referral \\nRefer section 3.1.3\\n3.10.4. Follow up Care\\nGenerally the hazards from choking are short-lived and do not require post-treatment. However, as the ASHA, you could visit the victim post-treatment along with the ANM to track any \\ncomplications. \\n3.10.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at Community Level\\nChildren or even adults usually choke from objects that they have accidentally ingested. \\nHowever, they may also choke when eating too quickly or when talking/laughing with food in \\ntheir mouths, inhaling smoke (choking on the soot of the smoke) etc. As the ASHA, you can \\nhelp create awareness in the community regarding prevention of choking accidents using the following messages:\\n1. Do not leave infants and small children unattended around toys or other small objects like coins, bottle caps, batteries etc.\\n2. Stay alert while eating or drinking. Supervise small children while they eat or drink. Educate parents to discourage their children talking/laughing while eating or eating too fast etc. \\n3. Making it a habit to always keep water next to oneself while eating. \\n4. Educate community on how to relive obstruction due to choking. Can be taught to volunteers, school kids, etc', 'Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_39': 'Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 39 3.11. Poisoning\\n3.11.1. Recognizing life-threatening situations\\nPoisoning can be caused by substances that are easily available both inside and outside \\nthe house. Cases of poisoning can be both accidental and intentional. However, irrespective \\nof the cause and intention, you as the ASHA, should always report cases of poisoning to \\nthe CHO and provide prompt stabilization and facilitate referral of the victim to appropriate nearest facility. \\nThe effects of poisoning depend on the substance, amount, and type of contact as well as the \\nage, weight, and state of health of the victim. \\nPossible symptoms of poisoning include:\\nNausea and/or vomiting\\n!!\\nDiarrhoea!!\\nRash!!\\nRedness or sores around the mouth!!\\nDry mouth!!\\nDrooling or foaming at the mouth!!\\nTrouble breathing!!\\nDilated pupils (bigger than normal) or constricted pupils (smaller than normal)!!\\nConfusion!!\\nFainting!!\\nShaking or seizures!!\\n3.11.2.

Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level\\nCases of poisoning are largely preventable and the best way to do that is to avoid contact with \\nharmful substances. \\nYou can use the following messages to create awareness in the community regarding the \\nprevention of poisoning: \\nKeep all household substances out of the reach of children. You should put them in high !!\\nor locked cabinets. \\nWear protective clothing, like gloves, when you use cleaners and chemicals.!!\\nIf you use chemicals inside the house, keep the area well aired.!!\\nDo not mix chemicals as mixed chemicals could become poisonous. !!\\nKeep medicines and chemicals in their original containers and label every such !!\\ncontainer. Get rid of old or expired medicines and household products. \\n!!\\nDo not drink spurious liquor.!!\\n3.12. Near-Drowning\\n3.12.1. Recognizing life-threatening situations\\nEven though we use the word “drowning” commonly to refer to suffocation from water entering \\nthe nose and mouth of a person, the correct word to be used is “near-drowning” which means \\nalmost dying from suffocating under water. This is the stage where emergency care is needed to \\nsave the victim’s life.\\nA victim of near-drowning could most probably be unresponsive which you will learn when you \\nconduct AVPU.  The other signs that are life-threatening are:\\nCold or bluish skin!!\\nAbdominal swelling!!\\nChest pain!!\\nCough!!\\nVomiting!!\\nNo breathing!!\\nErratic breathing!!\\nNo pulse!!\\nNail beds, slow or no circulation!!\\nMouth, nose or skin turning blue!!\\n3.12.2.

One of the new \\nservice areas that has been initiated in Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres is Ear, \\nNose and Throat care (ENT care).\\nENT takes care of three senses of the body – hearing, smell, and taste. It also has one of the most \\nimportant set of organs in the body that connects the external environment to the internal body, \\nthrough the ear, nose and throat.\\nProblems associated with these organs and related areas can cause a lot of health problems and \\ndisabilities in any person. Someone who has deafness problem will have great difficulty in integrating \\ninto society. The conditions related to the nose and throat area can lead to dangerous infections and \\ncancers.\\nAs an ASHA, you are a very important member of the Health and Wellness Centre team and are \\nclosest to the community. Therefore, you have a significant role in helping the health team in \\nscreening, referring, monitoring, and in health promotion activities. This also applies to problems \\nassociated with the ear, nose and throat.\\nThis module will act as a guide to help you identify various common ENT conditions, determine \\nwhat to do in these situations, and how to make people aware of what they can do to prevent these \\nconditions.

WAX\\n This is a common situation where some of the secretions in the ear canal harden after contact \\nwith dust and other outside particles and forms a soft substance called wax. Usually, there \\nis always a little wax in the ear canal. But if it increases in amount or gets hard, it can cause \\nreduction in hearing and a feeling of discomfort that something is in the ear canal.. \\nWhat it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nDark brown mass seen in ear \\ncanal;\\nDecreased hearing, blocking \\nof ear with pain in ear.Sodium bicarbonate ear drops 2-3 drops thrice daily for 4 \\ndays.

HEARING LOSS/ \\nREDUCED HEARING\\n Reduced hearing or loss \\nof hearing (deafness) is a \\ncondition where the person \\nis not able to hear anything \\nor can hear only loud \\nsounds. Hearing loss may \\naffect persons of any age \\ngroup.\\n Some babies are born \\nwith deafness (known \\nas congenital deafness) \\nwhich happens when the mother is exposed to certain infections, medicines or radiation during \\npregnancy.\\n As people grow old they slowly lose their hearing, usually after 65 years of age, due to \\nphysiological ageing process and this is called presbycusis.\\n Sometimes children and adults may also lose their hearing completely or partially due to various \\ncauses, like an injury causing rupture of the eardrum, severe infection of the ear, tumour in \\nthe ear, sudden exposure to very loud sounds (like explosions) or prolonged exposure to loud \\nsounds (like people working in factories with noise from heavy machinery).\\n Untreated hearing loss affects communication and thus may also contribute to social isolation \\nand loss of autonomy. Not being able to hear properly is often associated with anxiety and \\ndepression. Hearing loss in children can affect their growing up, education, interaction with \\nothers and personality development. Hearing loss in old age can impair the quality of life.\\n It is, therefore, very important to identify the people with hearing loss in the community and \\nrefer them to the CHO at the SHC-HWC. Since most of the diagnosis and treatment requires a \\nspecialist, the CHO and team will confirm the hearing loss by detailed examination of the person \\nand then refer him/her to the centre where there is an ENT specialist. Hearing loss is treated \\neither by surgery or by prescription of hearing aids.. \\n Your role in management of hearing loss:\\n1. Fill out the assessment of ‘Difficulty in hearing’ in Part B of the Community Based \\nAssessment Checklist.\\n2. If anybody complains of reduced hearing, inform the ANM and refer to the CHO at \\nSHCHWC.\\n3. Follow up with the person after he/she returns from the referral centre. If surgery is \\nadvised, ensure that the person gets the surgery done.\\n4. If hearing aid has been prescribed, follow up for regular use and ask if the person is \\ncomfortable.\\n', 'ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA_11': 'TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES11COMMON NOSE PROBLEMS\\nCHAPTER 04\\n1. SIMPLE VIRAL RHINITIS\\n This is the most common complaint in the community. It is known as the common cold and is an \\ninfection. Almost every person has had an episode of common cold. It occurs in every person. \\nIt is very contagious and spreads through sneezing, coughing or through sharing handkerchief, \\netc. It usually resolves on its own in 5 to 7 days. If it happens too often, then one needs to find \\nout the cause. \\nWhat it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nWatery nasal discharge;\\nWatering from eyes;\\nNasal stuffiness;\\nMalaise, fever and head -\\nache.Tab Paracetamol 500 mg as required.\\nSteam inhalation.\\nTab Chlorpheniramine 4mg twice daily if there is no relief or if \\ncold or allergy persists.\\nAdvise rest and drinking plenty of fluids.\\n2. ALLERGIC RHINITIS\\n With symptoms similar to that of a cold, the cause is usually some kind of allergy – to dust, \\npollution or specific objects, food etc. This watering from the nose, and eyes, along with sneezing \\nis usually more in the early morning. \\nWhat it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nWatery nasal discharge;\\nFrequent bouts of sneezing \\nabout 10 to 20 sneezes at a \\nsingle time;\\nBlockage of nose, Palatal \\nitching;\\nWatering from eyes with \\nredness & itching.Tab Chlorpheniramine 4 mg twice daily for 15 days.\\nSteam inhalation.\\nAvoid dust and known allergens.\\n3. ATROPHIC RHINITIS\\n This is a more serious kind of infection and involves a pus kind of discharge from the nose \\nwhich has a foul smell. In this situation, the patient must be referred to the Medical Officer in \\nthe PHC to diagnose and initiate antibiotic treatment.. ', 'ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA_12': 'TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES12What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nGreenish crusts present in\\nnasal cavity;\\nFoul smell from nose and \\npatient not aware of it;\\nNasal blockage, roomy \\nnasal cavity, nasal \\ndeformity, history of \\nmaggots.Nasal washing with sodium bicarbonate solution (1 tsp. in 250 \\nml. distilled water) 2 – 3 times a day which is to be continued.\\nRefer this person to the SHC-HWC for further confirmation and \\ntreatment. If antibiotics are required, the CHO will consult the \\nMO at the PHC.\\nYou can give the following advice to patients with rhinitis:\\n1. Drink plenty of water and get enough rest.\\n2. Sniff a little salt water into the nose \\nor breathe steam from hot water to \\nclear the nose.\\n3. No special diet is needed. However, \\neating oranges, tomatoes, and \\nother fruit containing vitamin C \\nmay help.\\n4. Do not take antibiotics if not \\nprescribed.\\n5. Contrary to popular belief, colds do \\nnot come from getting cold or wet \\n(although getting very cold, wet, or \\ntired can make a cold worse).\\n6. A cold is ‘caught’ from others who \\nhave the infection and sneeze the \\nvirus into the air.\\n7. To keep from giving his cold to others, the sick person should eat and sleep separately, and \\ntake special care to stay far away from small babies. He should cover his nose and mouth \\nwhen he coughs or sneezes and wash his hands often if possible.\\n8. Simple medicine such as Paracetemol helps lower temperature and relieves body aches \\nand headaches. More expensive ‘cold tablets’ are not recommended.\\n9. Wipe a runny or stuffy nose, but try not to blow it. Blowing the nose may lead to earache \\nand sinus infections..\\n4. SINUSITIS\\n There are big spaces called sinuses behind the forehead above the eyebrows and on both sides \\nof the nose. These spaces are usually filled with air and are useful to provide air and resonance \\nto sounds. When the lining of these spaces gets affected, usually because of infection, then it \\ncauses fluid to fill up the sinuses. This can turn into pus and become a painful condition. \\n', 'ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA_13': 'TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES13What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nHeadache, blocked nose, \\npurulent nasal discharge;\\nPain over the sinus area \\n– forehead above the \\neyebrows, or on either side \\nof the nose.Steam inhalation 2-3 times a day.\\nRefer to the SHC-HWC for confirmation and treatment by the \\nCHO.\\nIf the person requires antibiotics, the CHO will consult the MO\\\\ \\nat the PHC and initiate.\\n5. EPISTAXIS (NOSE BLEED) \\n Epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is a common complaint, especially during summer. In \\nmajority of cases, nosebleeds are self-limiting and spontaneous, but it may be of significant \\nconcern if it occurs repeatedly, there is heavy bleeding or if it occurs in children. It usually occurs \\nas a result of injury by fingernails, due to cold weather or in rhinitis. Sometimes it occurs in \\npeople who have other diseases like high blood pressure, or in case of tumours inside the nose. \\nEpistaxis may also be a result of trauma to the nose..\\nWhat it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nBleeding from the nose;\\nPain if there is injuryImmediate relief can be obtained by tilting the head forward \\nand pinching the nostrils together for 10 minutes. If it continues \\nbleeding, pinch nostrils together for 10 more minutes. If no relief \\nthen inform ANM and refer to CHO at SHC-HWC.\\nIn adults/elderly persons, the blood pressure also needs to \\nbe measured and if high then medicines need to be given in \\nconsultation with MO at PHC (ANM/ CHO will do this).\\nIf the bleeding is severe or the person is gasping/choking in blood, \\nor is unconscious, inform CHO and ANM and call an ambulance for \\nurgent referral.\\n6. FOREIGN BODY IN THE NOSE\\n Sometimes some foreign object may enter the nose either accidentally, or children may insert \\nobjects into their nose. This is very dangerous since it can result in difficulty in breathing and \\nmay even be aspirated into the airway.\\nWhat it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)\\nHistory of foreign body\\ninsertion;\\nPain in nose, headache;\\nBreathlessness;\\nBlocking sensation in \\nnose;\\nBleeding may be present \\nif the nostril is injured.If foreign body is visible and obvious and can be easily removed it \\nmay be attempted in consultation with ANM/CHO.\\nElse refer to CHO at SHC-HWC who will refer the patient to ENT \\nsurgeon in District Hospital/Medical College Hospital.', 'ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA_14': 'TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES14COMMON THROAT \\nPROBLEMS CHAPTER 05\\n1.

It feels like \\nsomething is scratching the throat. \\nCough is rare and dry. They don’t have pain, but \\ntheir voice can get hoarse.. \\nThere are many causes of irritation – it can be \\ndue to bacteria or viral germs. It could also be \\nbecause of allergies to dust. Many a times, it is \\ndue to gastric acidity which causes reflux into \\nthe throat. \\nHow to reduce irritation that triggers coughing:\\n1. Drink lots of fluids:  The most important \\nthing you can do is to drink plenty of water \\nto reduce dryness of your throat. Drink at \\nleast 1 and a half litres of water each day, \\nthat is about 6-8 glasses of water. Avoid \\ntea, coffee or soft drinks as they usually \\ncontain caffeine..\\n2. Breathing:\\na. a. Sit and stand with good posture – \\nthat is, neck and back straight and your \\nchin gently tucked in. This opens your \\nairway, makes breathing easier and \\nallows you to relax the throat.\\nb. Breathe through your nose. Mouth \\nbreathing dries your throat. Breathing \\nthrough your nose cleans, warms and \\nmoistens the air before it reaches your \\nthroat and vocal cords..\\n3. Talking:\\na. Limit harmful voice use, such as \\nshouting, grunting, or screaming. Talking, laughing or singing too loudly \\ncan also damage your vocal cords.\\nb.  Try not to speak over other noise \\nsuch as television or music or around \\nmachinery.\\nc. Do not whisper, as whispering \\nincreases air pressure in your vocal \\ncords and may irritate your throat. \\nd. Use your natural voice, not too high, \\nnot too low or not too loud.\\ne. Limit coughing and clearing your \\nthroat. Sometimes coughing can be \\nexcessive and clearing the throat can \\nbecome a habit. When you cough and \\nclear your throat it puts too much force \\non your throat and vocal cords..\\n4. Everyday\\na. Avoid chewing tobacco/paan/gutka, \\nand smoking cigarette/bidi, etc \\nb. Limit intake of caffeine containing \\ndrinks as caffeine can increase dryness \\nand irritation in the throat.\\nc. Do not smoke, avoid smoky \\nenvironment, and do not drink alcohol. \\nIt also increases the likelihood of \\nheartburn, which can also damage the \\nthroat and vocal cords.\\nd.

The focus of this module is to address the health issues, based on \\nyour learning from the previous training - Induction training and training on Modules 6 and 7, Reaching \\nthe Unreached and Handbook for ASHAs on Mobilizing Action on Violence Against Women.  As part of the PLA cycle, you will conduct meetings with community groups in your coverage area comprising of \\nall women and men, adolescent girls and boys, pregnant and lactating women, other community health \\nworkers, panchayat and VHSNC representatives. The module has been developed to help you engage \\nwith the communities in a way that is respectful and sensitive to existing inequities in the society.\\nThe module will help you to: \\nPrepare for the meetings. z\\nConduct PLA meetings using the methodologies explained in each section. z\\nMake the meeting process as participatory as possible. z\\nReflect on the key discussions in the meeting and prepare for subsequent meetings.  z\\nYou will be trained on using the module in three rounds of five days each. During the training \\nall methods for conducting PLA meetings will be explained in detail.

The cluster meetings will also be used to practice and plan for PLA meetings as well \\nas to discuss issues in conducting PLA meetings. This meeting will provide an opportunity to incorporate feedback to improve the meeting  process further by bridging gaps and taking \\ncorrective action.\\nDuring the induction phase of PLA (first month), ASHA facilitator will conduct 20  meetings i.e, 2. \\none meeting per ASHA in the first month.In subsequent months (second month onwards), all ASHA facilitators will conduct 10 PLA 3. \\nmeetings with 10 different ASHAs in her supervision area.

After feeding all of \\nthem she would take whatever was left over.   At the age of 13 when her menstrual period started, \\nshe had excessive bleeding and she looked very pale.  Her mother thought that her skin looked \\nfair, not pale. At 16 years she was married and soon after she became pregnant.  During pregnancy \\nher mother-in-law prevented her from taking rest and taking more food.  She did not have any ANC \\nand did not take If A tablets.  One day the ASHA noticed that  Shila looked sick and asked her to get \\nher blood tested, but Shila’s mother-in-law did not allow it.  The ASHA advised her to take green \\nvegetables, fruits and If A, but she did not take them.  Shila delivered a stillborn baby in the 8th month.  \\nWhen she had high bleeding after childbirth, the doctor advised her to go to a higher centre where ', 'PLA Module for ASHA_English_39': 'MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 39she could be given blood, but the ambulance was not available.  Because they did not have enough \\nmoney, the  family decided to bring her back home. Her mother-in-law gave her just one meal in \\nthe day  consisting of rice with garlic and salt and made her do all the house work.\\nShila became breathless after doing routine work and when she went to the well to collect water \\nshe fainted. Her family members called the faith healer to perform rituals and also got her treated \\nby the informal provider,  but Shila did not regain consciousness and when her husband tried to \\ntake her to hospital, she died on the way. \\n Ask one of the members to repeat the story using the picture cards that will remain on the  z\\nground.\\n Tell the members that they will play ‘the chain game’ to help them identify solutions for preventing  z\\nmaternal under strategies nutrition. This practical and visual exercise will help participants to \\nunderstand and analyze the causes and help them to identify strategies to prevent under nutrition. \\nAsk the members “why did the mother die?” to arrive at all the underlying causes. (Use the ‘but  z\\nwhy?’ game as in meeting 5).Allow the members to think of possible causes that may have led to the mother’s death.  z\\nKeep a note of all the responses and group the different causes under 4 categories: z\\nNutrition (green color) \\x8d  – having to do with feeding practices.\\nCultural Practices (yellow color) \\x8d  – having to do with people’s attitudes, customs, beliefs, etc.\\nIllness (red color) \\x8d  - caused by infections (virus, parasite, bacteria) or deficiencies, etc.\\nEntitlements (blue color) \\x8d  - related with government services and benefits.\\n', 'PLA Module for ASHA_English_40': '40 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHA You can use paper bands or ribbons of four different colors to represent the four major categories  z\\nand explain what each of the colors represents.\\n While reminding the group about the causes mentioned by them earlier, ask them to classify the  z\\ncauses under the 4 categories.\\n You will use a cut out/ dummy of a woman for this game. z\\n Randomly distribute the colored ribbons/ bands among the participants.

When \\ntheir mother went out for work,` their grandmother took care of Ali and gave him bottle feeds. One day Shabnam returned from school to find her brother very dull. Her grandmother said that he was having diarrhoea since morning and has passed watery stool more than three times.  She also told Shabnam that she has not given any food or milk to Ali as he will not be able to digest any food in this condition. Shabnam remembered that her school teacher once told them that diarrhoea can be caused because of unhygienic food or water and it could be very serious in a small child. The teacher had also told them that just like a plant which dies in absence of adequate water; if human body loses high quantity of water then the person can become weak and may even die.  Shabnam convinced her grandmother to give Ali something to drink quickly otherwise his condition may worsen. She told her grandmother that she had learned to prepare rehydration solutions at home, and she would later get ORS packet from the ASHA. Grandma was happy that Shabnam was learning new things, and she also remembered how her neighbor had lost her child due to this illness in the past.\\n', 'PLA Module for ASHA_English_73': 'MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 73Shabnam then prepared the ORS for her brother.\\n* One glass (200 ml) of water, add a pinch of salt and a spoon of sugar.\\n++\\nWhen Shabnam’s mother returned home in the evening, she informed the ASHA (Sarita) about \\nAli’s illness. Sarita was very impressed with Shabnam’s knowledge and said that she had done \\nthe right thing by giving home based ORS to Ali. Sarita also informed them that diarrhoea can \\nhappen because of taking food with unclean hands, taking uncovered food and unclean water and because of transmission by faecal - oral route. She also informed them about some danger \\nsigns to identify severe dehydration, (like lethargy or unconsciousness, sunken eyes, inability to \\ndrink or drinking poorly, skin pinch going back slowly) requires urgent referral to health facility \\nwhile rehydrating the child with frequent sips of ORS/ fluids on the way to facility. However, if \\nthe baby is restless or irritable, with sunken eyes, drinks eagerly or is thirsty and skin pinch goes back slowly, it indicates some dehydration, and if the child is given fluids and food along with \\ncontinued breastfeeding, it helps in recovery.   \\nShe also told them some important and useful things for babies over 6 months of age:\\nRehydration is adequate when the baby has a normal urine output (eg. 5-6 times a day).•\\t\\nAdditional solutions like dal and rice starch can be given to children who are not vomiting. •\\t\\nOther infection can also be associated with diarrhoea - measles, pneumonia, malaria•\\t\\nBreastfeeding/feeding should be continued during illness (like diarrhoea).•\\t\\nProper hand washing can help in prevention of diarrhoea.•\\t\\n One ORS packet should  be dissolved in one litre of clean drinking water [* Packets of ORS •\\t\\nwhich have expired or are damaged (lumping, turning brown, and difficulty in dissolving) \\nshould be discarded}]\\nSafe handling of drinking water should be ensured.•\\t\\nASHA demonstrated ORS preparation to Shabnam’s mother and left 2 packets of ORS for Ali \\nfor further use.

She also fed both the children before leaving for work without washing her hands with soap. Her daughter played by herself all day in the mud in the courtyard and often complained of itching in her toes. When Mina visited the VHND, the ANM said that her daughter was very thin, though her abdomen was swollen and she was undernourished.  Mina  said that she ate 4-5 times a day, yet she looked weak. The ANM then asked her a few things- \\n“do you wash your hands with soap before cooking?” \\n“do you clean the vegetables before cutting them?” “do you clean your hands with soap after you clean the children after defecation?” \\n The ANM then said “If you have not been doing these things then your child may have worms \\nin her stomach.

After the rains, water had collected in all the broken pots, \\npot holes in the village and there were a lot of mosquitoes in and around the house. After a few days when her child had fever on alternate days with chills and vomiting, her husband called the faith healer. However, \\nthe fever continued and within a week all three children had similar fever with vomiting. When returning \\nfrom her work in the field Maya saw a group of women discussing about malaria and she heard the ASHA saying that any fever could be malaria and that can sometimes even lead to death. She also came to know that ASHA could do a blood test and give the medicines. Maya took all the three children to the ASHA, who \\ndid the blood test and said that all had malaria. She also said that one of them who was very sick had brain \\nmalaria and needed to be hospitalized. She gave medicines for the two children and accompanied Maya to the hospital for treatment of the third child.  ASHA advised them to use the bed nets while sleeping and also prevent water stagnation for preventing breeding of mosquitoes.  At the time of discharge, the doctor asked if the family used the insecticide treated bed nets that were distributed to all households.  Maya informed \\nhim that they had received nets but her husband was using it for fishing. To which the doctor said that many \\nfamilies get malaria because the bed nets are used for purposes other than sleeping under the mosquito net.  There are many other diseases that are caused by mosquito bites, like, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, etc. Maya then decided to share this information with other villagers in the group meeting.

There \\nare many ways the person with the mental health disorders and the family can help themselves. \\nThere are some misconceptions about treatment of mental health disorders.

Mental illnesses are treatable with proper treatment and counselling.\\nLack of willpower causes mental illness. Willpower does get affected due to mental illness but is not a cause of mental illness.\\nMarriage can cure mental illness. Marriage cannot cure mental illness; it can act as a stressor.\\nMentally ill patients belong to hospitals. Majority of persons with mental illness can be treated at out-patient settings or primary care settings. \\nMental health problems are only seen in illiterate, poor people.Mental health problems may occur to anybody, irrespective of caste, education or class.\\nPeople with mental illness can never be productive or do normal work like normal people.People with mental illness on regular treatment and supervision, can very well lead a productive and qualitative life like any other normal person.', 'MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english)_7': 'Introduction to Mental Health and Mental Health Disorders  |  7Myth Fact\\nMental illness is unlike physical illness; the \\nillness is really all in person’s head.Mental illness is just like physical illness since both are biologically based.\\nMentally ill people have weak characters since they can’t cope with the world in the same way that the rest of us do.The Development of mental illness has nothing to do with person’s character.

Common Mental Disorders\\nWhat are common mental disorders?\\nThese include depression/tension/stress and anxiety disorders. \\nDepression/ Tension/ Stress: We all experience short-term sad moods (e.g., when we have an  ~\\nargument with someone, when we feel lonely, when we fail an exam). Sadness becomes an illness when it lasts for a prolonged period or starts to interfere with our daily activities and \\nrelationships. It is termed as depression. \\nAnxiety disorders: We all experience worry and fear in certain situations (e.g., when we have \\n ~\\nto perform something new). Fear is a natural reaction to danger and helps us to activate our \\nenergies (e.g., in the old days to run away from a wild animal). Fear becomes a mental health \\ndisorder when it is long-lasting or starts to interfere with our daily activities and relationships. \\nIt is called as ‘anxiety disorder’ .\\nHow will recognize that someone has common mental disorder?\\nThe person may complain about,\\nSleeping problems or feeling tired or weak ~\\nLoss of interest in regular activities ~\\nDifferent physical problems and aches ~\\nThe person may appear,\\nA bit slow in movement and thinking ~\\nWith a sad or worried expression on the face ~\\nRestless (e.g., fidgeting with hands) ~', 'MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english)_18': '18  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  19An individual may experience any of the following symptoms\\nSymptom 1: An unusually sad mood or extensive fear remains longer \\nthan 2 weeks\\nFeelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness or negative thinking  \\x9d\\nabout him/herself (‘I can’t enjoy anything anymore’ , ‘I am a \\nfailure’ , ‘I am a burden’ , ‘I did everything wrong’ , ‘it’s my fault’ , ‘it will never get better’)\\nUnreasonable fears (e.g., the permanent worry that a family  \\x9d\\nmember might get ill, recurrent attacks of fear in certain \\nsituations)\\nThoughts to be better off dead (suicidal thoughts) \\x9d\\nSymptom 3: Complaints that interfere with at \\nleast one of the person’s daily activities\\nThe person spends a lot of time at home  \\x9d\\nor in bed\\nThe person is unable to go to work or do  \\x9d\\nthe householdThe person withdraws from his/her  \\x9d\\nfamilySymptom 2: Physical complaints\\nDifferent aches (e.g., headache,   \\x9d\\nback-pain, stomach-ache)\\nSleeping problems \\x9d\\nLoss of appetite \\x9d\\nTiredness and loss of energy \\x9d\\nPalpitations, sweating, restlessness \\x9d\\nCASE  1 \\nDuring a home visit to Mr. Raju’s house, the family tells the ASHA that Mr. Raju has become very withdrawn, \\nconfining himself to his bed most of the day, saying that he is feeling very tired if his family asks him what is wrong, and not taking any interest in family activities. During the recent village festival, he had refused to take the lead in the arrangements (which he used to regularly do before), saying he is feeling tired and does not feel like it. When the frontline health worker talked to Mr. Raju, he said that he has no strength to do anything and just wants to lie down, he is feeling very sad and feels there is no future, and that he does not feel like living anymore.\\nWhat can be the probable disorder in the above scenarios?

After administering the PHQ-2, you will refer the individuals who have scored more than 3 \\nto SHC-HWC. Community Health Officer (CHO) at SHC-HWC will ask the individuals more detailed \\nquestions to understand about the symptoms. CHO will ask questions from a detailed tool called ', 'MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english)_43': 'Service delivery framework: Providing mental health care as a team and Key tasks of ASHA  |  43‘PHQ-9’ to these individuals and provide appropriate advice. The individual will be provided help at \\nSHC-HWC or can be referred to PHC-MO by CHO. \\nYou should also be careful not to create a scare in the community about these disease conditions. \\nYou must explain to the people that the checklist is not for diagnosing anyone of the condition. They \\nneed to be screened by CHO first, followed by visit to Medical Officer/specialist for confirmation, if \\nnecessary. \\n3. Recognizing the symptoms of Mental health disorders\\nYou have learnt the symptoms of different disorders. This can help you in recognizing the symptoms and providing appropriate information to the individual and family. Recognition of symptoms is a \\nfirst step and referral to the CHO or MO can guide for early detection of disorder, if any. It is critical \\nto understand that presence of symptoms does not provide us with complete information and will require detailed assessment to confirm a disorder. Therefore, even if a individual presents with symptoms, he/she should not be labelled with disorder. \\nYou may come across the individual presenting with such symptoms, during your home visits \\nfor providing other services (HBNC, HBYC, other surveys, follow up visit for NCDs etc.) or through \\ninteraction with community members. \\n4. Providing Mental Health First Aid\\nAs an ASHA, you are in a unique position to provide help to individuals experiencing any kind \\nof symptoms of mental health disorder. If you recognize such symptoms in any individual, your \\nfirst step would be to encourage the individual for accessing medical care at nearest healthcare \\nfacility. You have an important role in providing assistance and helping the individuals to seek appropriate help. At the same time, you will need to provide basic care till called ‘Mental Health First Aid’ before such medical care is available. You have learnt in detail about the steps in chapter \\n3 and chapter 4. \\nEssential steps in Mental Health First Aid are –\\nListen without judgement ¡\\nAssess risk of suicide and harm to self to others ¡\\nGive reassurance and information ¡\\nEncourage the person to get appropriate professional help ¡\\nEncourage self-help treatments, follow up and treatment compliance ¡\\n5.  Providing advice and support to the family of individual with mental health \\ndisorder\\nFamilies of individuals with mental health disorders are also under stress similar to families of \\nindividuals with any long-term illness. Moreover, limited information and stigma against the disorder \\ncan increase the stress. Therefore, family members also require support. They need to be provided \\nwith right information regarding the disorder and care options to help the individual. \\nFamily members can also play a key role in helping the individual to get better. As an ASHA, you \\nwould provide support to the family members and provide them with right information about disorder, available care options.

Undertaking home visits for ensuring treatment compliance \\nMost of the mental health disorders would require a long-term medication. If not medication, they would need continuing support to maintain mental health. You will play a key role in ensuring \\ntreatment adherence.

Violence against women spans across different stages of life starting from as early as before the birth of a girl child and extending till old age. You would have heard of cases of elimination of the foetus (unborn child) because it is a \\nfemale. Sex and gender are complex determinants of gender violence. “Sex refers to the biological \\nand physiological characteristics of men and women. “Gender”  refers to roles, behaviours, \\nactivities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women. \\nSome examples of sex characteristics are: \\nWomen menstruate while men do not\\x80\\x80\\nWomen have breasts that are usually capable of lactating while men have not\\x80\\x80', 'ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English_3': 'Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 3 Neglect of the girl child is common and is visible in \\nvarious forms such as- depriving them of breast milk, \\ngiving them less food than their brothers or feeding \\nthem after the boys in the family, not taking them to hospitals in case of illnesses, not allowing them to go to school and getting young girls married before they \\nattain the legal age for marriage i.e, 1 8 years etc. \\nYou would have also seen women being teased, \\nmolested or heard of sexual assaults on women and \\n,acid attacks on women. Sexual violence can also \\nhappen to children (girls and boys) from newborn through adolescence.\\nOther instances of violence include harassment for dowry, crimes committed to preserve the honour of a family or clan or community (killing \\nor sexually assaulting the young couple if they \\nchose to marry against societal/family norms), women facing intimidation and harassment at the \\nworkplace, or in schools or in public places. \\nIt is not only girls and young women who face \\nviolence. Older women are also often victims of violence, and are often neglected, not provided \\nwith health care or nutritious food or are made to do menial work or are even abandoned. \\nDomestic Violence is one of the most common forms of \\nviolence against women. It is inflicted by the husband or \\nother close family members. Domestic violence includes all the above mentioned categories of violence i.e, \\nphysical, emotional, economic and sexual. Any sexual \\nassault including rape committed by the husband or any other family member should also be considered as sexual violence against the woman. This type of violence is \\nfrequently invisible since it happens behind closed doors \\nand often the community does not treat it as a type of violence but considers it as a “private family matter”, and accepts it as a normal part of life. \\nOften women who are abused are reluctant to seek help because of feelings of shame and \\nguilt, fear of being blamed, no economic independence, no confidence that the organizations \\n', 'ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English_4': '4 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN(Police, doctors) can help them , (as a result of negative experiences), fear of consequences, \\nprotecting the family’s reputation, or thinking it won’ t happen again. One big reason women \\nendure violence is that there are no alternatives. Raising her voice often leads to the woman \\nbeing thrown out of her marital family and she is often not supported by her natal family. This fear often prevents women from speaking out. A woman living alone, or with her natal family is also not accepted in the society. \\nViolence against women leads to various physical, mental and social consequences. It results \\nin women being denied their rights and entitlements, makes for low representation in public/ \\npolitical spaces, denial in positions, of decision making and even restricts their access to \\nschools, health facilities and employment. \\nAs an ASHA you are close to the women of your community and already share a rapport \\nwith them, which makes it easier for you to identify who is at risk or who is facing such forms of violence.

Preventing violence: by increasing awareness and mobilizing community against any \\nact of violence against women\\nB.  Addressing violence: Attending to the individual women who has suffered from violence. \\na. preventing violence - role of asha at the Community level:\\n1.  Build solidarity: Violence against women is a reflection of deep rooted socio-cultural \\nbiases, and needs sustained, long term awareness raising and mobilisation of the \\ncommunity. It is difficult for you as an individual , acting alone to address the issue of \\nviolence against women. \\n  You need to build partnerships with other community based groups such as Village Health Sanitation and \\nNutrition Committees (VHSNC), Gram Panchayat or \\nother village level social support groups working for women such as-Mahila Mandals, women self-help groups, Mahila Swasthya Sanghas or Mahila Panchayats. You can also form a group of ASHAs \\nworking under the same PHC area to generate \\nsupport for taking action on violence. To enable this you can use the forum of monthly PHC review meetings. During these meetings you will be able to hold discussion on issues of violence with the group of ASHAs and also build solidarity. Sometimes women facing violence need urgent support. You should coordinate with these groups who could help in providing an informal support and shelter for women \\nfacing violence. These groups can also dialogue on a broader platform to address the key \\nproblem that has led to violence and resolve other issues of violence at the village level. \\n  Ensure discussion on the issue of violence against women with other important stakeholders such as- representatives of Panchayat, women’s groups, local community \\nleaders, parents of girl children. Building solidarity with groups that have the participation \\nand voice of women at village level meetings will make the issue of violence against women more prominent and visible.\\n  Violence against women is also common in situations of family rivalries and in religious \\nor caste based conflicts. Women are generally viewed as property or posession and \\nare often the first ones to be attacked. In these cases you should overcome your own internal barriers of being associated with a particular group and strive hard, making special efforts to reach out to such women.\\n', 'ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English_12': '1 2 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN2.  Educate the community and increase awareness: Building awareness and mobilizing \\nyour community to prevent violence against women should form a part of your core \\nactivities. You should organize meetings with adolescents and women in your village to \\ndiscuss this issue. You can do this by-\\n Dispelling beliefs such as- “beating is a form of expressing love; being abused is \\x80\\x80\\nalright for me; a woman cannot live without \\nher partner even if he abuses her; it’s a woman’s fault that she faced rape or a girl a should be married off early as it prevents her from getting sexually abused. \\n Educating adolescent girls and women during \\n\\x80\\x80\\ntheir monthly meetings on violence issues and \\nenabling them to share any experience so that action can be taken.\\n Raising awareness on various legal provisions or Acts that prohibit domestic \\n\\x80\\x80\\nviolence, sexual harassment etc (Annexure 1)\\n Using the VHSNC to organize mobilizational campaigns around dowry related \\x80\\x80\\nabuse, pre-birth elimination of female foetus, girl child infanticide, early childhood \\nmarriages, registration of marriage, giving inheritance to girls, honour killings, trafficking of girls, and girl child discrimination.\\n Disseminating information to the community members on various welfare schemes \\n\\x80\\x80\\nof the government to promote social and economic empowerment of girls and \\nwomen.

Be alert to the issue: You can find out if a woman is at risk or facing violence by being \\nalert and looking for clues that will help you in identifying such women. For example: a husband who displays controlling behaviour, or is unwilling to leave the woman’s side when you are talking to her, should alert you to the possibility of abuse. Look for the presence of injuries that do not match the explanation of how they occurred. \\n  If you have identified a woman at risk of violence or being subjected to violence even if she has not reported it, you need to obtain more details regarding the violence. Any action you take should be discussed with the woman, otherwise she will be put at increasing risk. If the woman is not yet ready to speak out, then provide her with emotional support until she is.\\n', 'ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English_13': 'Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 1 3   You should distinguish between severe forms of violence where the woman is in need of \\nurgent interventions, from less severe forms of violence which are no less damaging but \\ndo not have life threatening consequences. \\nWhat will you do when you are confronted with a severe case of violence: Shift the \\nwoman to safe place immediately. When you come across violence directly in front \\nof you or there is a situation where the violence can be a threat to a woman’s life. Take \\nimmediate action. You should immediately find a family member or another member of \\nthe community (whom you trust) to remove the woman from the source of violence. If required you can seek police protection. You can seek shelter for the woman in shelter or \\nshort stay homes available in the area or contact other NGOs who provide support and \\nservices to help the woman in distress. \\n2.  Ask questions.  Questions should always be asked privately and in a non-judgemental \\nmanner. Direct questioning on violence may not give you an answer. Build the trust of the woman and reassure her that the information she shares will be kept confidential. Remember that asking questions in front of her family members or partner can put her in danger. \\n3.  Enable access to health services: You should assess if \\nthe woman is suffering from any physical injury or mental \\ntrauma. Provide first aid for minor injuries but if you \\nnotice other serious effects refer her to an appropriate health care facility and escort her if necessary and ensure follow up.\\n4.  Provide emotional support: As an ASHA you can \\nbecome her primary confidante and help by making the woman break silence and share her feelings about the experience of violence. Talk to her and help her overcome the feelings of shame, fear, anger and depression. Reassure \\nthat abuse is not her fault. \\n5.  Take measures for the woman’s safety: Explain to the woman that she should try and \\nanticipate situations when violence is likely to occur and seek a safe haven for herself and her children.\\n', 'ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English_14': '1 4 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN  In situations where the woman is determined to leave the abusive individual, you \\nshould with the help of community/VHSNC help her in identifying a safe space like her \\nmaternal home, a friend or relative’s house where she can be temporarily located until \\nthe situation is resolved. In some districts, government or NGO run centres are also functioning to support women in distress. You can support the woman in seeking shelter at these centres if support from family and friends is not available  \\n  When the woman leaves try to make sure that she carries all the important documents such as-identity card, bank pass book, ration card, her and the children’s birth certificate, \\nmarriage registration or proof, educational certificates, health related records, assets or \\njewellery on her name, etc. \\n  It is important to confront the perpetrator of violence so that there is no repetition of such violence episodes and raise awarenss about the legal provisions avialble for women \\nunder the law.

Inform the woman on legal recourse:  You should also \\nshare information with the woman regarding places \\nor persons to contact in case she wants to report the \\nviolence and seek action for the violence faced. Most districts in the country have a Women’s Police Station. \\nShe could also contact functionaries of the Women and \\nChild Department (AWW, ICDS supervisors, CDPOs).

You may have come across individuals \\nwho complain of toothache or pain in their gums. Diseases of the oral cavity are seen among children, \\ninfants, adults and old people. \\nOral health focuses on keeping the oral cavity healthy. This includes the teeth, tongue, inner surfaces \\nof cheeks and lips, roof of mouth and floor of mouth.  \\nFortunately, most of these diseases are easily preventable if one adopts good oral hygiene practices\\n -  Oral infections can lead to heart problems\\n -  Inability to eat properly\\nFigure 1 Part of healthy mouth', 'Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA_9': '9\\n9\\nTraining Manual on Oral Care for ASHA \\nat Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresPARTS OF THE HEAL THY MOUTH \\nTeeth –  Humans have two sets of teeth: (i) Milk teeth/baby teeth/primary teeth, which erupt during \\nthe first two years of life and shed between 6-12 years of age, and (ii) Adult teeth/permanent teeth, \\nwhich start erupting at 6-7 years of age and remain lifelong. There are four types of teeth in humans: \\n(i) Total 8 incisors or front teeth, (ii) Total 4 canines or conical teeth, (iii) Total 8 premolars and (iv) \\nTotal 12 molars. All teeth have an outer surface towards the cheek and lips, inner surface towards the \\ntongue and the biting/chewing surface.\\nFigure 2 Cross Section of a Healthy tooth\\nTongue  – The tongue has four surfaces: upper, lower and two side surfaces.\\nPalate  – The roof of the mouth is called the palate, which is formed by hard palate towards the front \\nand soft palate behind.\\nLips and cheek  – These consist of the surfaces of the cheek and lips inside the oral cavity.\\nGums – It is the layer which covers the teeth and attach them to the jaw bone.

Therefore you need to ensure that everyone in the community from a newborn baby \\nto the elderly maintain good oral health.  \\nInfants:\\nBreastfeeding is important for growing healthy teeth and strengthening gums of the baby. It is \\nessential to initiate breastfeeding within an hour after birth, practice exclusive breastfeeding for the \\nfirst six months of life and continue breastfeeding till two years of age.   If a baby is bottle fed, they \\ncan develop gum diseases. ', 'Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA_11': '11\\n11\\nTraining Manual on Oral Care for ASHA \\nat Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresChildren:\\nAt this age, children are very vulnerable to getting tooth decay. This happens because of poor oral \\nhygiene and improper tooth brushing. Also increase in intake of sweets and junk food can lead to \\ncavities in the teeth. In small children (0-6 years old) sometimes, certain cavities affect upper front \\nteeth and are common mainly in those who are fed bottled milk. \\nAdolescents and adults:\\nThis is the age when people develop the habit of chewing tobacco or smoking.  Tobacco consumption \\ncan affect the Oral health in several ways and is leading cause of Oral cancers. Also, poor oral hygiene \\nand improper tooth brushing can cause several oral health problems. Women tend to ignore \\nsymptoms till it is  late after which they have complications. \\nElderly:\\nThe main problem in elderly is missing teeth. Maintaining oral hygiene and use of properly fitting \\ndentures can prevent teeth and gum diseases in the elderly. Many old people also chew tobacco or \\nsmoke. They can be prone to oral cancers.

ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION \\nAs you have learnt in other modules, health promotion focuses on \\n y Keeping people healthy\\n y Helping people make changes in lifestyle to prevent diseases\\n y Motivating behaviour changes to avoid complications among those with diseases\\nSimilarly, prevention and control of health problems also involves these principles. The three main \\nways in which you can help prevent oral diseases among people in the community are:\\nA. Oral health promotion – Prevent oral diseases from occurring in individuals by helping them \\nadopt healthy lifestyle practices such as proper tooth brushing. \\nB. Diagnosis and treatment – Early detection of oral diseases in individuals and help them get \\nprompt treatment so that the disease is controlled at an early stage, especially in oral cancers.\\nC. Prevent complications of the disease and its progression to late stages in the individual by \\nfacilitating complete treatment and follow ups.\\nADOPTION OF HEAL THY PRACTICES\\nOral health promotion focuses on \\n y Teaching proper tooth brushing techniques\\n y Explaining how to adopt healthy lifestyle to prevent oral diseases\\n y Creating awareness among people regarding common oral diseases\\n y Getting people to go for regular annual oral health check-up after the age of 30 years. \\nHow to maintain a Healthy Mouth\\n1. Good oral hygiene\\na. Brushing teeth\\n y Brush teeth at least twice a day (after waking up in the morning and before going to sleep at \\nnight). Brushing teeth before going to sleep is more important since it removes all food particles \\nwhich provides suitable environment for the germs to create mouth problems like bad breath, \\ntooth decay etc. \\n y The correct technique of brushing teeth is shown in the diagram below. It should be followed \\nto make brushing effective. In this chapter, you will learn:\\n 1. What is oral health promotion?\\n 2.   How to maintain a good oral hygiene?\\n 3.  Risk factors and Prevention of Oral Diseases ', 'Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA_13': '13\\n13\\nTraining Manual on Oral Care for ASHA \\nat Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres y Teeth should be brushed for at least two minutes every time with a soft toothbrush and pea-\\nsized amount of toothpaste. \\n y Ideally, toothbrush should be changed every three months or when the bristles start to flare. \\nIn addition, toothbrush should be discarded in case the person suffers from any respiratory \\ninfection and a new toothbrush should be used after recovering from the illness.\\nFigure 4 Brushing Technique\\nb. Cleaning tongue\\n y The tongue should be cleaned using the toothbrush or a tongue cleaner every time along with \\nbrushing teeth.\\n y The technique of cleaning tongue is shown in the picture below. \\nFigure 5 Tongue cleaning after brushing Figure 6 Tongue cleaning with the help of Toothbrush\\n', 'Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA_14': '14\\n14\\nTraining Manual on Oral Care for ASHA \\nat Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centresc. Rinsing of mouth after every meal\\n y The mouth should be rinsed with water after every \\nmeal. This helps remove any food particle stuck to \\nthe teeth which can cause tooth decay. \\n y If possible swish water in mouth for 2 minutes or at \\nleast 60 seconds\\n2. Eating right\\n y Eating too much of sweet and sticky foods like chocolate, toffee, chips, cold drinks, gajjak, rewdi \\ncan lead to tooth decay. After eating these items, the mouth should be rinsed properly with \\nwater. Snacking between meals should be avoided. A healthy diet is essential to maintain healthy \\nteeth and gums. A well-balanced diet should be taken including grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts \\nand dairy products.\\nFigure 7 Consume Balanced diet Figure 8 Avoid food causing caries\\n3. Avoiding tobacco use\\n y The use of tobacco in any form (smoke \\nor chewable) causes stains on teeth and \\nincreases the risk of gum disease.

Can decay occur early in childhood, what should be done when decay is noticed early in \\nchildhood? \\n Yes. Continuous bottle feeding of sweetened milk to infants after weaning, particularly at night \\ncan lead to rampant decay of all teeth, sparing the lower front teeth. Immediately after the first \\ntooth erupts, it is important that the mother consults a dentist and gets advised on importance \\nof oral hygiene early in life. \\n3. What has to be done to avoid staining of teeth? \\n Regular tooth brushing and mouth rinsing habits can help avoid staining on teeth. In case stains \\npersist, a dentist has to be consulted. \\n4. How often should teeth be cleaned by a dentist? \\n If maintained well, a regular check-up once a year would suffice. Cleaning is essential only when \\nplaque deposits harden to form calculus tenaciously attached to the gum. \\n5. Can salt / manjan be used for cleaning teeth instead of tooth paste? \\n Gul manjan / manjan / tooth powder or any other such material is found to contain abrasive \\ncompounds that can lead to wearing off the tooth enamel. Also, it is found that Gul manjan \\ncontains tobacco and thus can be addictive leading to oral ulcers / cancer. \\n6. What can be used to clean teeth? \\n It is advisable to use a soft bristle brush and pea size of tooth paste to clean teeth twice a day. \\nThis avoids plaque accumulation and prevents decay and gum diseases. \\n7. How to keep teeth healthy? \\n Brushing once in the morning and always before sleeping along with a practice of rinsing mouth \\nwith water after every meal is the best way to keep teeth healthy. Mouth rinsing should also be \\npractised after eating sweet / sticky food like cake, bread, biscuits, chocolates, candies, rice etc. \\n8. What is the reason for whitish stains on teeth? \\n Presence of whitish stains on teeth following a specific pattern covering multiple upper and \\nlower front teeth is indicative of Dental Fluorosis. It occurs due to excessive fluoride in the ground \\nwater supplies of that region. It needs to be evaluated by a dentist for severity assessment and \\nnecessary action. Also, if found in excess, the authorities concerned need to be alerted about \\nfluoride in water. ', 'Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA_36': '36\\n36\\nTraining Manual on Oral Care for ASHA \\nat Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres9. What are clefts and why do clefts occur? Can this be treated? \\n A split or opening in the roof of the mouth or the lip is called a cleft. The cause could be genetic \\nor certain drugs during early pregnancy or also undernourishment during pregnancy. It is \\nimportant to report to a doctor immediately after birth to understand treatment protocol and \\nfeeding practices. \\n10. What to do when teeth do not begin to erupt even after the age of 1 year? \\n Consult a dentist before any further options are considered. \\n11. Can irregularly aligned teeth be corrected, if yes when? \\n Yes. Consult your dentist. Some children need correction of crooked teeth and bite as early as 3 \\nyears while some may need treatment around 12 years. \\n12. What is the best way to help a person quit smoking / chewing tobacco? \\n Advising them to delay tobacco use, divert the mind from the thought of tobacco, drink about \\n4-5 litres of water a day, do exercise and identify a quit date to completely forgo tobacco is \\nsomething any person can do. In addition, referral to the nearest health facility for personalised \\ncounselling can help. \\n13. How important is it to fill milk teeth? \\n Milk teeth guide the eruption of permanent teeth and act as natural space maintainers for \\nthe permanent set of teeth. Also, they are important for functional aspects like chewing and \\nspeaking. It is thus important to keep milk teeth healthy and get decayed milk teeth filled. \\n14. Why should a child rinse mouth after using medicated syrups? \\n Most medicated syrups for children are made palatable by adding sweetener. If left uncleaned, \\nthe retention of syrup on teeth can lead to decay.

This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA. The training plan envisages a total of 20 to 24 days of residential training, to impart the skills that these two modules are teaching.  \\nacknowledgements\\nThe sections on maternal and newborn care are excerpted from the SEARCH Manual on ‘How to Train ASHA in Home-Based Newborn Care’ and SEARCH developed ASHA Reading Material on Home-Based Newborn Care.

About 46% \\nof the children below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly one out of two children weigh less than they should for their age.

Exclusive Breastfeeding: Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; \\nnot even water should be added. \\n2. Complementary Feeding: At the age of six months, add other foods. \\nBreastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding\\tfor\\tat\\tleast\\tone\\tto\\ttwo \\tyears\\tmore.\\tThere\\tare\\tfive \\tthings\\tto\\t\\nremember about complementary feeding:(i)\\t Consistency:\\tInitially\\tthe\\tfood\\thas\\tto\\tbe\\tsoft\\tand\\tmashed.\\tBut\\tlater,\\t\\nanything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less spices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. ‘give daal not daal ka pani’.\\n(ii) Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about \\none year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as the mother.\\n(iii)\\tFrequency:\\tThe\\tamount\\tof\\tcomplementary\\tfoods\\tgiven\\tshould\\tbe\\tequal\\t\\nto about half what the adult needs in terms of nutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has to be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day . \\n(iv) Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in \\nenergy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food .\\tFamily\\tcould\\tadd\\ta\\t\\nspoon of it to every roti/every meal.

Though useful for everyone, it is of particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea. \\n(c) Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that cause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are more common and life threatening, than in normal children.\\n(d) Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and\\tthen\\trepeated\\tonce\\tevery\\tsix\\tmonths\\ttill\\tfive \\tyears\\tof\\tage.\\tThis\\ttoo\\t\\nreduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in malnourished children.\\n(e) Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during the illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more rigorous in handwashing and more careful in handling the baby.\\n(f) Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an\\tinsecticide\\t treated\\tbed\\tnet.\\tMalaria\\ttoo\\tis\\ta\\tmajor\\tcause\\tof\\tmalnutrition. \\t\\nparticular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea. \\nYou should encourage parents and other family members to spend time with \\nthe child as it matters a lot.

Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain.

You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule.\\nRafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, \\nbut there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete.

The presence of even one general danger sign is enough to indicate \\na severe disease. A danger sign calls for immediate referral. Where signs of common illness like cold and cough, fever, and diarrhoea are present without any of the danger signs, and where there is no doctor, you could provide some home-based care to the child and keep a watch for signs that indicate the need for referral. \\nWhat are the questions to be asked when seeing a sick child?\\nEvery child who is seen for an illness should be checked for the presence of the following general danger signs: •\\t Not\\table\\tto\\tdrink\\tor\\tbreastfeed•\\t Vomits\\teverything•\\t Has\\tconvulsions•\\t Is\\tlethargic\\tor\\tunconscious.\\nHow to assess a sick child for danger signs?\\nStep 1: ASK: Is the child able to drink or breastfeed?

This is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito. There are two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very dangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs. \\nHow does it spread?: When the mosquito bits an infected person, the parasite \\nenters the mosquito’s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’s stomach and then when it bites another person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’s saliva and infects him/her . \\nSigns and Symptoms\\n• The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur \\non alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with Falciparum type infection. \\n• Sometimes the patient has continuous fever, malaise, and headache.\\n• Malaria affects more frequently and more severely children below five \\nyears, pregnant women, or patients who are already ill. \\n• Falciparum malaria can affect the brain: causing clouding of \\nconsciousness, fits, or paralysis leading to death.Objectives of the sessionBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Understand and be able to communicate key facts about malaria and its \\nprevention.\\n• Making a blood smear and testing blood using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria. • Managing fever in the young child- when to suspect malaria, how and when to \\ntest, when to refer, when and what to treat.\\n• Understanding spread of TB and methods of diagnosis. • Supporting treatment of TB and follow-up with patients.', 'Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English_60': 'ASHA Module 7\\nSimple Skills that Save Lives\\n60Who is at higher risk? : In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant \\nmothers and malnourished children are at greater risk.\\nHow to suspect malaria: Any person living in a malaria affected area, who \\ndevelops fever must be suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and rigor and headache, it is even more likely. \\nHow to confirm:  There are two ways of confirming malaria:\\n• Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit the patient’s blood can be tested \\nfor malaria (Please see Annexe 4). If the test is positive then the patient \\nhas malaria. \\n• You should also make a blood smear. (Please see Annexe 5). The parasite \\ncan be seen in the blood smear Sometimes the blood smears can be negative, and a repeat smear is required. \\n RDT and Smears are to be taken before starting treatment. All ASHAs \\nworking in a block with a high incidence of malaria need to be trained for taking smears for malaria. \\nTreating Malaria\\n1. Give paracetamol for fever. Also sponging with warm water to bring \\ndown temperature when needed.\\n2. If RDT is positive for malaria- Give chloroquine or Artesunate \\nCombination treatment (ACT) drug as recommended. (Annexe 7) The dose of the drug depends of the age group. The exact dosage schedule is given in Annexe 6. Nowadays the recommendation is to treat for malaria only if the test is positive. If the test is not available, or cannot be done, it is permissible to give a course of chloroquine. This would still be needed in many areas. \\n3. If despite treatment fever does not begin to come down within two or \\nthree days, or persists even after a week, referral becomes mandatory. \\nReferral to ANM or doctor is necessary if there is no response and fever continues \\nor if patient becomes delirious. \\nPrevention of Malaria\\nMosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There \\nare many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito that transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at night. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in clean water. That is why during rainy season, where water collects, this forms a good breeding place for mosquitoes. \\nASHA Module 7\\nor if patient becomes delirious. \\n', 'Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English_61': 'Part D\\nIntroduction to Infectious Diseases\\n 61Ways of controlling malaria: There are two ways:\\nDo not allow mosquitoes to multiply :\\n• Spraying insecticide where mosquitoes sit when they \\ncome to bite inside the houses.\\n• Drying up breeding pits.\\n• Not allowing water to stagnate- pouring a spoon of \\noil over the water surface in small collections. This is \\nenough to kill the mosquito larvae. \\n• Enable cultivation of Gambusia fish in ponds and \\nwells- these eat up the mosquito larvae. Also remove the grass from banks of pond. Larvae find it difficult to breed if there is no vegetation and the pond edges are vertical. \\n• Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in \\none place and it should be flushed and cleaned once in a week.\\nDo not allow mosquitoes to bite• Clothes that cover the body, like full sleeved shirts. \\n• Mosquito nets treated with \\ninsecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net may die later. \\n• Use of mosquito repellent, e.g. \\nburning neem leaves to drive mosquitoes away.\\nThe Role of ASHA in Prevention and Management of Malaria\\ni. During house visits and in the village meetings you should inform \\nthe community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. You should also inform the community of the services you can provide for malaria and request that for any case of fever you should be contacted.\\nii. Encourage and help the village health and sanitation committee and the \\nwomen’s groups or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. \\niii. Where possible, ask those with fever, who you suspect of having malaria \\nto go to the primary health centre. You should facilitate this. It is only if the patient cannot go the same day, that you should take on the task of diagnosis and treatment of the suspected patient with malaria till such time as the qualified service provider is accessed. \\n', 'Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English_62': 'ASHA Module 7\\nSimple Skills that Save Lives\\n62iv. All fever cases that approach you and are unable to go to the primary \\nhealth centre within a day, should be screened using RDT and blood \\nslides. Fever cases which turn out to be RDT positive should be provided treatment immediately. You should store the positive RDT along with the blood slide for Quality Assurance (QA) check at a later date. For cases which are RDT negative, you should send blood slides to the laboratory. For those with a positive result, you can treat the cases following the drug regimen in which you are trained. \\nv. All fever cases should be given paracetamol and fever managed as per \\nthe guidelines. The persons who test positive for malaria would be given with either chloroquine drug or ACT drugs (depending on the instructions in that area) followed by primaquine for radical treatment. \\nvi. Whenever you do a blood test or give a drug you should make a record \\nof it in your diary. You should, provide the information during the monthly ASHA review meeting to the ANM or to your supervisor. If payment is being made for this work, you may be also required to maintain a register.\\nvii. Transport of slides and obtaining the result of the test: The \\nslides collected by you should be delivered to the sub-centre by you or by anyone whom you request, on a day to day basis. These slides should then be transported to the PHC lab preferably twice a week, or less by the MPW (M) and if not, the MPW (F). The results should be conveyed to you by the MPW (M) and if not the MPW (F). \\nviii. If there is a pregnant woman in a high malaria area, you \\nshould facilitate her getting a insecticide treated bed net at the time of the first antenatal care check up and follow up to see that she uses it. After delivery you should ensure that the baby from the time of birth also sleeps under an insecticide treated bed-net. Diary\\nix. If a pregnant woman gets high fever and chills, ensure that she is taken to see a doctor. You could start Chloroquine or ACT  immediately if there is a delay in seeing a doctor..

TB can affect any part of the body. When it affects the lungs, it is called pulmonary TB. The commonest form of TB is pulmonary TB. It affects over 2 million people in India. TB in any other part of the body (i.e. other than lungs) is called extra-pulmonary TB.\\nHow does TB spread?\\nTB germs usually spread through tiny droplets in the air, when a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis coughs or sneezes. When these droplets are inhaled by a healthy person, s/he gets infected with TB. This infected person will have a 10% lifetime risk of developing TB. Spread of disease is increased in poorly ventilated houses where many people live close together or in high dust areas like mines and quarries. An undernourished or malnourished patient is also at a high risk of contracting and dying of TB. Both drugs and nourishment are needed to achieve a cure in such persons. Children can also get both forms of TB.\\n When should TB be suspected?\\nThe symptoms of pulmonary TB are:• Cough with sputum for two weeks or more\\n• Pain in chest• Sometimes the presence of blood stained sputum (haemoptysis) with \\nsymptoms like:\\nu\\u2003Rise in evening temperature\\nu\\u2003Night sweats\\nu\\u2003Loss of weight\\nu\\u2003Loss of appetite.\\nA person with cough for two weeks or more is a suspect for TB and should be \\nreferred to a PHC/CHC/DH for the confirmation of diagnosis. \\nHow to diagnose TB?\\nSputum examination is the main tool for diagnosing pulmonary TB.\\nThe diagnosis is made when the germ is present in the sputum of the \\npatient. At least two sputum samples have to be tested (one of which has to be collected first thing in the morning at the patient’s home and the other at the health facility).

When coughing, the patient must put a protective clean cloth over his mouth to prevent spread of droplets or leave the house and cough in a nearby open space. The cloth should be washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis. \\n• The patient should not have close contact with spouse, children and \\ninfants and the elderly within the family at least for two months after starting treatment.

Unfortunately, \\nthis often leaves suffering unattended. It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in serious health-related \\nsuffering every year.\\nThe suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  \\nPalliative care addresses serious health related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing with these \\nnecessitates multi-disciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do including the patient and family, \\nthe community around them and all participants in health care delivery.\\nIf we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course of \\nthe disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever disease-\\nspecific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.\\nAnd palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family, and therefore even when the patient dies, \\npsycho-social support may have to be continued for the bereaved family.\\nThis training program is aimed at empowering every health care provider to be a partner in reducing health related \\nsuffering in our country.', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_3': '3\\n3\\nContents Page No.\\nIntroduction to the module 4\\nSuggestive schedule of sessions 5\\nChapter 1: Introduction to Palliative Care 6\\nChapter 2: Communication Skills 10\\nChapter 3: Management of symptoms 14\\nChapter 4:  Basic Nursing Skills 18\\nChapter 5:  Home care 26\\nChapter 6:  Psychosocial and Spiritual Support in Palliative Care 31\\nChapter 7: End of life care 36\\nChapter 8: Community participation in palliative care 40\\nChapter 9:  Palliative Care in National Health Programmes 43\\nChapter 10: Role of ASHA in Palliative Care and Service Delivery Framework 45\\nAnnexure 1: Suggested format for documentation of Palliative Care Services 49\\nAnnexure 2: Home visit case sheet 50\\nAnnexure 3:  Follow up case sheet 53\\nAnnexure 4: Home Care Kit 55\\nAnnexure 5: Community Based Assessment Checklist 53\\nReferences 59', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_4': '4\\n4Introduction to the module\\nIndia is currently in phase of epidemiological transition and has to deal with the double burden of Communicable \\nand Non-Communicable diseases [NCD]. Currently NCDs contribute to about 2/3rd of mortality in our country. \\nHowever, the public health system of our country is predominantly directed towards dealing with the communicable \\ndiseases. This changing health scenario has been recognized by the National Health Policy-2017. The policy \\nenvisages to “Improve health status through concerted policy action in all sectors and expand preventive, \\npromotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services provided through the public health sector with focus on \\nquality”. This was further emphasized in the concept of comprehensive primary health care in the Ayushman \\nBharat Yojana. The expanded list services related to NCDs and Palliative Care will be provided through the Health \\nand Wellness Centres [HWC].\\nPalliative care is required for patients with a wide range of life-limiting health problems. The majority of adults \\nin need of palliative care have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (38.5%), cancer (34%), chronic \\nrespiratory diseases (10.3%), AIDS (5.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). Patients with many other conditions may require \\npalliative care, including kidney failure, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, \\ncongenital anomalies and drug-resistant tuberculosis.\\nASHA & Multipurpose Health Worker (Female/Male) have been recognized as the frontline workers for community \\noutreach activities of Health & Wellness Centre.

It relieves suffering and improves the quality of both life and death.\\n ∙Palliativecare:\\n -Respects life but also regards death as a normal process\\n -Does not quicken or postpone death\\n -Provides relief from pain and other difficult symptoms\\n -Looks after the psychological and spiritual issues\\n -Helps the patients live as actively as possible until death\\n -Helps the family during the patient’s illness and after the death\\n Chapter 1: Introduction to Palliative Care\\nHistory of Palliative care in India\\n ∙In the olden days, in India, there were places built where the dying was cared for, like in Varanasi. In the \\nwest, the Christian missionaries took care of the old and dying in institutions called ‘hospices’.\\n ∙The modern scientific palliative care was started by Dame Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom, from \\nwhere it spread to other parts of theworld. \\n ∙Palliative care units in started in 1980s. Most of the palliative care centres in India are located in the \\nSouth, especially Kerala where community involvement has been the outstanding factor.

NCDs, earlier \\nthought to be diseases of the rich, actually affect poor people more as the poor have unhealthy living conditions, \\npoor nutrition, more high-risk behaviour and cannot afford medicines and hospitals. All this leads to more \\npsychosocial problems.\\n ∙Most people pay for treatment out of their own pocket which pushes millions into poverty every year.\\n ∙Patients with chronic diseases need not only medical treatment but regular support from their community. \\nCurrent health care system is mostly meant for care of acute, not chronic illnesses. It is only the community \\nthat can support these needs.\\n ∙With more people living in cities and joint families becoming less common, the traditional social support is \\nno longer available, adding to the difficulty.\\nWho are the members of Palliative Care Team?\\n ∙Palliative care requires a team approach. It requires various specialists working with palliative care physicians, \\nnurses, social workers, spiritual care guides, community health workers, physio therapists as well as the \\npatient’s family. Community based volunteers, health workers are very important members of this team.\\nWhere are palliative Care Services provided?\\n ∙Palliative care can be given any where - at home, in the hospital or in a place for the terminally sick which is \\ncalled a ‘hospice’.\\nFigure 3: Access to palliative care servicesPhysical Psychological\\nSocial SpiritualPatient & \\nFamily\\nFree standing \\nhospices Inpatient care in \\ngeneral settingOutpatient care Home based', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_9': '9\\n9\\n ∙In India, home care is considered better because patients are more comfortable in their own home.

It is subjective and varies from \\nperson to person. It is both a physical and an emotional.\\nWhat are the dimensions of Pain?\\n ¾It has three dimensions- physical, psychosocial and spiritual. This concept is called – ‘Total pain’. Without \\ntaking care of each part, we cannot treat pain properly.\\nFigure 6: Dimensions of pain\\nWhat are acute and chronic pain?\\n ¾Acute pain like that of injury and surgery causes patients to cry with pain or roll around. It decreases with \\ntime as healing takes place. It is treated with tablets or injections when needed.\\n ¾Any pain that lasts more than three months is called chronic pain. Chronic pain causes permanent changes \\nin the nerves, so the treatment is different from that of acute pain.Chapter 3: Management of symptoms\\nThree dimensions \\nof PainPhysical\\nPsychosocial\\nSpiritual', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_15': '15\\n15\\n ¾Chronic pain however, does not decrease with time. It increases as the disease advances. However, the \\npatient may not cry or even look like he is in pain. He becomes quiet, with drawn, loses appetite and sleep \\nand may lie quietly in a corner, not talking to any one.\\n ¾ A combination of medicines may be needed. As the disease advances, the patient may need increased doses \\nor more medicines. This does not mean that he has become addicted.\\nWhat are the non-pharmacological (non-drug) methods to manage symptoms?\\nThese are non-drug methods to help control pain \\n ¾Physiotherapy, hot and cold packs and massage\\n ¾Proper positioning, reassurance, diversion therapy, art or music therapy, acupressure and acupuncture can \\nhelp.\\n3.2: Breathlessness\\n ¾Breathlessness occurs in almost half of the patients referred for palliative care. It can be very frightening. It \\nrestricts activities. There is loss of independence, frustration, anger and depression. Breathlessness at rest \\ncan cause anxiety and panic attacks. Patients often fear suffocating to death. Explanation and support are \\nimportant.\\n ¾Management:\\n1. Oxygen: may help in few cases where there is less oxygen in the blood but in cases where the lungs are \\ndestroyed by the disease, it may not help.\\n2. Non-pharmacological (non-drug) treatment-This is very important treatment modality, and the family \\nshould be taught about this.

Such \\npatients will need to be cared for at a hospice or their homes. Since most of our patients prefer to be cared \\nat homes, home care palliative care services should be provided.\\n ¾Home based palliative care has several additional advantages for the patient and family such as comfort, \\nprivacy, familiarity with surroundings, security, autonomy and a greater degree of independence. \\n ¾It is also cost effective and as it does not entail travelling to the hospital repeatedly for follow up visits and \\nunnecessary investigations and treatments. \\n ¾Some additional advantages of home care include:\\n1. Easy access to care: The patient and family have access to advice and to all aspects of palliative care \\n(physical, psychological, social and spiritual) at their doorstep.\\n2.  More effective caring: Advice, training and additional support for the family is available so that they can \\nbecome more effective in their role as care givers and feel abler to manage and cope.\\n3. Access to complementary services: The home care team can facilitate liaison with complementary and \\nsupportive services when required. The patient and family do not have to go out seeking such support \\non their own.\\n4. Maintains confidentiality: This is especially important for people with Cancer & HIV/AIDS who may \\notherwise be shunned by the community out of ignorance and due to misconceptions about the disease.\\n5. Spreading awareness in the community: Wherever appropriate, home care programmes can be used to \\nspread awareness about palliative care. It is often the case that when a family is nursing someone with \\ncancer their friends and associates become more aware and are more willing to discuss issues around \\nterminal care. The family being cared for, too, can become ambassadors for the cause.Chapter 5: Home Care', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_27': '27\\n27\\n6. Mobilizing local resources:  Local support groups and volunteers can be mobilized to support patients and \\ncare givers living in their particular area. They would be more willing to do this not only because they may \\nknow or have personal ties with the people affected but because it is much easier for neighbours to help \\neach other than travel long distances to do so.\\n ¾Home care thus provide an avenue where palliative care can be practiced in all its domains [Physical, Social, \\nPsychological, Spiritual] most effectively. \\n ¾The aim is to address “Total Pain” of patients and their Care Givers and improve the quality of life of the \\npatients and their relatives.\\nWhat is the composition of a Home Care Team?\\n ¾The Home Care Team consists of professionals trained in Palliative Care namely a Medical officer, a community \\nHealth Officer, a Nurse, Multipurpose Health Worker (Female/Male), community volunteer. All the member of \\nthe team need not be available for all the visits. The composition of team can be decided based on the type \\nof patients during the visit. The visit would be arranged and co-ordinated by ASHA.  \\nHow Does a Home Care Function? \\n ¾Each team caters for an area served by the Sub Health Centre - Health and Wellness Centre or Primary Health \\nCentre - Health and Wellness Centre. \\n ¾ASHA will identify bed-ridden patients and others needing palliative care be offered home care visit. This is \\nfollowed by visits by MPW/CHO for further assessment using Palliative care screening tool\\n ¾The first visit to the patient’s home takes 2 Hours. The Palliative Care issues of the patient and the family are \\nidentified (Medical, Nursing and counseling). Urgent issues are addressed during the first visit. \\n ¾The patients are categorized into High, Middle and low priorities depending on their Palliative Care needs. \\nThe High priority patients are visited once/twice or more often every week. Middle priority patients are \\nvisited once a fortnight. Low priority patients are visited once a month. These priorities are changed as and \\nwhen required. \\nWhat are the scope of services in home care?\\nThe services that can be provided as part of home care vary from setting to setting. Following services are \\ngenerally included as part of home care.\\nFigure 12: Services provided as part of home careNursing careSymptom  \\nmanagementBereavement \\nsupport\\nResource \\nmobilizationpsychological \\nsupportSocial  \\nSupportSpiritual  \\nsupport\\nEnd of Life \\nCare \\nHome  \\nCare', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_28': '28\\n28Documentation of the work\\nA case sheet for every registered patient is maintained by the team [Annexure 3].

[Annexure 1]\\nUniversal precautions\\nIntroduction\\nFaced with concerns about the spread of serious infections, hospitals and health centers have begun using a \\nsuccessful technique that is also appropriate in many other settings. Rather than waiting to find out who is \\ncontagious, they treat everyone as a potentially infected person. The name of this infection control method is \\n“universal precautions”; and it gives a set of guidelines to follow when you come into contact with body fluids and \\nwastes that carry germs. It is not a lot of extra work and it really pays off. Health Care Workers who might come \\ninto contact with blood and other body fluids to practice the following infection control practices at all times with \\neveryone:  \\n ¾Hand washing\\n ¾Use of Personal Protective Equipment [eg. latex gloves]\\n ¾Cleaning and disinfecting of contaminated areas/instruments\\n ¾Proper disposal of waste materials\\nThe concept of Universal Health Care Precautions emphasizes that all our patients should be treated as though \\nthey have potential blood/ body fluid borne infections and can infect the caring health care workers. \\n1. Hand washing\\n ¾Hand washing is the most important infection control measure to prevent illness\\n ¾The amount of illness can be drastically reduced, if hands are washed at proper times and with the proper \\ntechniques.\\n ¾Hands should be washed with soap for at least 30 seconds, rinse them thoroughly and dry thoroughly.\\n ¾Hand washing should occur immediately before and after any patient care activities\\n \\nFigure 13: Steps of handwashing\\n', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_29': '29\\n29\\n2. Personal Protective Equipment [PPE]\\n ¾Personal protective equipment, is “specialized clothing or equipment, worn by an employee for protection \\nagainst infectious materials.” The items include gowns, gloves, masks, respirators, cap, face shield and \\ngoggles.

You may start from the most distressing issue \\nand move on to the others\\n ∙The patient and family may not share all their feelings during the first visit but may do so later. If they do \\nnot want or are un comfortable discussing a certain topic, do not force them. You can discuss these issues \\nlater when a good rapport is built\\n ∙Allow them to ask questions.

However, there is a great deal that you can do on your own to \\nassist a patient who may be struggling with psychosocial and spiritual issues because of a debilitating and life \\nlimiting illness. This is known as empathic communication.\\nThe most valuable thing you have to offer someone else is YOU. Being consciously aware of your own behaviour, \\nwhat you say and do, and how you conduct yourself, makes the contact with the patient and family. Remember, \\nwhat the person you visit will remember most clearly is you, not what you did or said.\\nTherefore, before anything else, you need to reflect on what kind of beliefs and prejudices you have that may \\nfacilitate or impede the process of rapport building.\\nWhen people get sicker and approach the end of their life’s journey, there is often a great deal of spiritual \\nsuffering. Each person needs to come to terms with their own losses in their own way. We are there to walk with \\nthem in that journey, not to tell them what to think, feel or believe. It is therefore important that we don’t try and \\ntake the suffering away by trying to impose our own spiritual solutions onto their spiritual struggles. \\nKey points to remember:\\n ∙Psychosocial and spiritual needs of patients and caregivers\\n ∙Each one of us deals with a chronic, life altering and debilitating illness, as well as with the possibility of dying, \\nin our own unique way. Our age and level of maturity, our socio-economic status, our personality, all play a \\nrole. However, based on numerous studies and observations, the following emotions have been identified as \\nmost likely to influence the behaviour of a sick person:Chapter 6 : Psychosocial and Spiritual Support in Palliative \\nCare', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_32': '32\\n32 -Anger (Why me?)\\n -Fear (What will happen to me?)\\n -Loss (I have lost everything that gave my life value)\\n -Guilt/Blame (I should have gone earlier to the doctor/I did not have the moneyto see a proper doctor)\\n -Shame (How will people now treat me and my family?)\\n -Grief/Despair (This will only get worse and end in suffering and death)\\n -Hope (I shall remain pain free and continue to function independently)\\nThese emotions are a result of the difficult circumstances that people find themselves in which rob them of their \\nprevious sense of normalcy and security. They may also test and alter relationships within the family and with \\nfriends.\\nWhat are the needs of the patient? \\n ∙To participate in own illness\\n ∙To be treated with respect\\n ∙To be heard and to ventilate feelings\\n ∙To continue to live with dignity\\n ∙To resolve conflicts\\n ∙To receive peace and forgiveness\\n ∙To get permission to die\\nWhat are the needs of the family?\\n ∙To be able to express feelings openly\\n ∙To ask questions and receive honest answers\\n ∙To get help to resolve family conflicts,etc.\\n ∙To get reassurance and information\\n ∙To receive affordable medical, nursing and emotional support\\nIn the Indian situation, we are often faced with dilemmas based on our culture:\\n ∙Who to communicate with?\\n ∙What to communicate?\\n ∙How to communicate?\\n ∙When to communicate?\\nWhile there are no easy answers, as every situation and family differ, as a rule of thumb the following may be \\nkept in mind:\\n ∙Focus on patient and main decision maker\\n ∙Gauge readiness of patient and family to accept the truth', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_33': '33\\n33\\n ∙Give bad news in small doses. This allows the patient and family time to absorb the information being given.\\n ∙Respect silence. Do not rush in. Wait for are sponse.\\n ∙Do not answer direct questions such as, “When will I die?” or “How long do I have?” Instead, explore further. \\nAsk a counter question like, “Why do you ask?” or “Is there anything in particular that you want to do?”\\n ∙Do not neglect children as they are also part of the family dynamic.\\nLike anything else, listening needs to be practiced so that it becomes effortless. Here are a few useful tips:\\n ∙Ask open-ended questions like “How are you feeling?” or ‘What is your concern?”\\n ∙Reflect what is being said: “so what you are saying is that you feel very angry because…”\\n ∙Clarify/Do not assume\\nRecognising and responding to psychosocial and spiritual distress\\n ∙Main care give must do a psychosocial assessment of the patient. This will help identify psychological trauma \\nas well as signs of depression. It will also bring to light spiritual distress because of unresolved family matters \\nrelated to forgiveness, feeling that God has abandoned them, fear of punishment after death, etc.\\nThe nature of the patient’smood:\\n“How exactly are you feeling?” -The severity\\n“How bad does it get?” - The frequency\\n“How often do you feel this way?” -The duration\\n“How long does it last?” -The triggers\\n“Is there anything that makes it worse?”- The impact\\n“How does this affect your day-to-day life?”\\n“How does it affect you?”\\nThe same may be done for the main caregiver. \\nAfter the assessment, one must deal with these issues as best one can or, depending on their severity, identify \\nthem and inform to ANM.\\nDealing with emotional issues:\\n ∙Most patients will have unfocused anger which may even be directed at you. The best way to deal with this is \\nto listen without interruption. By the time they finish, they will be relieved of their anger and grateful to you \\nfor giving them the opportunity to express themselves.\\n ∙Fear is another common emotion. If not openly expressed it will continue to grow. Patient’s often have \\nunfounded fears that can be relieved through discussion. They should be encouraged to list their fears and \\nprioritise them so that they can be dealt with one at a time. This makes fear more manageable.\\nThere are patients who become uncommunicative and withdraw. Do not assume that they do not want to talk. \\nConsider why they have withdrawn. Here are a few possibilities:\\n ∙Fear\\n ∙Embarrassment (perhaps due to disfigurement)', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_34': '34\\n34 ∙Depression (sense of worthless ness)\\n ∙Confusion (feel rejected and lost)\\n ∙Anger\\n ∙Denial\\n ∙Think no one is interested inthem\\n ∙Suspicion/Lack of trust\\n ∙Physical disability (for example have lost voice-box)\\n ∙Very often after the death of a patient care givers feel guilty. They feel that they did not do enough: “If only \\nI had had more money?” “If only I could have taken him or her to a particular hospital?” etc. The best way \\nto deal with this is to ask the care giver to make a list of the things they did do for the patient. This will help \\nthem realise that they have done a great deal and make them less guilty.\\n ∙Shame and stigma tend to be associated with diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. It is important to talk \\nopenly with the patient and the family and to answer all their questions.\\n ∙Over time, a shift in attitude is likely to take place.\\n ∙Never forget hope; it always has a place no matter what the prognosis. Our task is to foster it at all stages but not \\nto give false hope. We must find out what the hopes of patients are by asking them. The same holds true for care \\ngivers. We may ask: “What is your hope for your loved one?” Usually what patients and care givers are looking \\nfor is more control over their situation so that they can move from a feeling of helplessness to one of hope.\\nDealing with spiritual issues:\\nPatients who are dying often ask questions like: “How much time do I have?” “When will I die?” “What will \\nhappen to me after I die”, etc. It is best to help them explore their fears and respond with empathy rather than \\nprovide answers. This is not the occasion or time to inflict your own religious belief or personal point of view on \\nthe patient.\\nPatients often confide that they wish to go to God in peace. Often what they are asking for is helping to resolve \\nsome unfinished business. It could be need for forgiveness from a loved one, reconciling with an estranged relative, \\nor reaching out to someone who has rejected them. It is a good practice to ask permission from the patient and \\nthe family before you reach out to the concerned person on their behalf.\\nThere are patients who talk about ending their lives. As palliative care practitioners, we believe that this is a cry \\nfor help that can be met with the right medical, nursing, psychosocial and spiritual response. However, we should \\nremain vigilant to suicidal tendencies, to clinical depression and to mental illnesses that may predispose patients \\nto take this extreme step.\\nWe must direct them to the appropriate consultant.\\nThis holds true for the bereavement phase too. There may be care givers who are finding it difficult to cope with \\nloss and grief after the death of a loved one. This may be compounded by poverty, especially if the person who \\ndied was the main bread-earner. While grief is natural we should be able to recognise grief that refuses to resolve. \\nParents often find it difficult to accept the death of a child. Care givers may also have their own set of spiritual \\nquestions at this stage: “How is my loved one?” “Where is he or she now?” “How could God allow this?” ‘Will I \\nsee them again when I die?” Once again, it is not the answers we give that matter as much as how comfortable \\npeople are to discuss their deepest feelings with us and thereby find inner peace.', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_35': '35\\n35\\nImportant points\\n1. Palliative Care is incomplete unless we address psychological and spiritual issues of patients and their care \\ngivers.\\n2. Often our attitudes and biases stand in the way of us becoming effective healers. Self-reflection must go hand \\nin hand with the acquisition of knowledge and skill.\\n3.

Currently it has been integrated with National Programme for Prevention and Control \\nof Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS).\\n ¾Goal: \\nAvailability and accessibility of rational, quality pain relief and palliative care to the needy, as an integral part of \\nHealth Care at all levels, in alignment with the community requirements.\\n ¾Objectives:\\nThe key objectives of the programme are as following:\\n ∙Improve the capacity to provide palliative care service delivery within government health programs.\\n ∙Refine the legal and regulatory systems, support implementation to ensure access and availability of \\nOpioids.\\n ∙Encourage attitudinal shifts amongst healthcare professionals\\n ∙Promote behaviour change in the community\\n ∙Develop national standards for palliative care\\nThe major strategies proposed are provision of funds for establishing state palliative care cell and palliative care \\nservices at the district hospital.\\nNational Health Policy:\\nThe latest National Health Policy was adopted in the year 2017.  The policy recognizes the growing need for \\npalliative and rehabilitative care for all geriatric illnesses and advocates the continuity of care across all levels.\\nThe objective of the policy is to “Improve health status through concerted policy action in all sectors and expand \\npreventive, promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services provided through the public health sector \\nwith focus on quality”. Chapter 9 : Palliative Care in National Health Programmes', 'Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC_44': '44\\n44The policy denotes important change from very selective to comprehensive primary health care package which \\nincludes geriatric health care, palliative care and rehabilitative care services. It envisages enhanced capacity \\nbuilding related to Palliative care both in health services and training. Palliative care has also been considered to \\nbe part of Right to Healthcare by the policy.\\nPalliative Care in other National Programmes:\\nRecently Palliative Care services are also included under other national health programmes. \\n ¾National AIDS Control Programme has identified the palliative care as an important component of the car, \\nsupport and treatment in managing the HIV pandemic. The focus is on symptom management of patients, \\npsychosocial, spiritual and bereavement support for both patients and families. Home care has been considered \\nto be of great importance in meeting the palliative care needs of HIV positive patients and families. Children \\n(both HIV positive and negative have been identified as special focus group) Peer counsellors, outreach \\nworkers (ORW), link worker or ASHA are expected to play important role. \\n ¾National Tuberculosis Elemination Programme has also identified the unmet palliative care needs of palliative \\ncare especially in those suffering from drug resistant tuberculosis. Palliative care would be offered through the \\nnodal DR-TB centers or at the community level under guidance of nodal DR-TB center. Necessary services \\ninclude pain relief, psychosocial support, respiratory physiotherapy, nutritional support etc. \\n ¾Ayushman Bharat Yojana:\\nAyushman Bharat Yojana launched in 2018, has two components:\\n1.

It is more common in the tribal population of India but occurs in non-\\ntribals too. It leads to anaemia, pain, and reduced growth, and affects many organs like the \\nlungs, heart, kidneys, eyes, bones, and brain.\\nThe tribal health expert committee report, 2018 has listed sickle cell disease as one of the 10 \\npriority problems in tribal health. About 1 in 86 births among the tribal population have SCD, \\nthe prevalence being higher in Central, Western, and Southern India. However, now SCD is \\nfound across all ethnicities and communities.\\nStates with prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease include- Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, \\nMaharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil \\nNadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh & Assam. Tribal \\ncommunities in India have poorer health indicators, a greater burden of morbidity and \\nmortality, and limited access to health care services. To enable access to affordable and \\nquality health care for all SCD patients, and to lower the prevalence, Government of India has \\nlaunched a mission to eliminate sickle cell disease by 2047. \\nThis will improve the care of all Sickle Cell Disease patients for a better future and will lower \\nthe prevalence of the disease through a multi-faced coordinated approach with focus on \\nscreening and awareness strategies.\\nA community health worker, MPW (M/F) / ASHA will play a pivotal role in eliminating sickle \\ncell disease through health promotion and prevention activities in the community.', 'Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA_5': '6Figure 1 Prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease in India', 'Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA_6': '7\\nCHAPTER 1: \\nUNDERSTANDING SICKLE CELL DISEASE\\nLet us first understand what Sickle cell disease is.

This \\nmakes them tired easily.   \\nFrequent infections Children under the age of five are at the highest risk. \\nMainly infections can occur in the lungs, blood, and brain.\\nFever - A fever may be the first sign of an infection. \\nJaundice –  Yellow colour usually seen in the white of the eyes. This is usually \\na mild and common problem.\\nEpisodes of pain -  Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are \\nmajor symptoms of sickle cell disease. Pain occurs in Joints, Chest, Back, and \\nAbdomen. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few \\ndays. Some people have only a few pain crises while some may have more. \\nSwelling of hands and feet -  The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red \\nblood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet.\\nDelayed growth or puberty -  A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow \\ngrowth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers.\\nVision problems  -  Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become \\nplugged with sickle cells.

They could belong to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes \\nand minority communities. \\n• Women headed households: Where the husband works outside the \\nvillage, where women are separated or deserted by their husbands, or the husband is dead, where women have alcoholic husbands, or husbands \\nwho are differently abled and women bear the sole responsibility for \\nearning a livelihood and taking care of the family. \\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_20': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child20\\n• Families living in distant hamlets/tolas, whose houses lie between villages on hilltops or in \\nthe fields, or in areas which are cut off during the rainy season. \\n• Families living in slum/slum like locations, homeless people \\nliving on roadsides, under bridges, flyovers, along railway tracks, \\nin night shelters, homeless recovery shelters, beggars’ home, leprosy homes, etc. \\n• Families with differently abled children, unaccompanied \\nchildren, elderly people or families where there is no adult \\nsupport. Families having members living with HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis, Leprosy, etc.\\n• Migrant families, either those who migrate into the village community, or those who stay outside the village for livelihood such as to urban areas- cities, towns, etc. and return periodically. \\n• Families engaged in unorganised/informal work and hazardous \\noccupation- construction, brick and lime kiln workers, head \\nloaders, sex workers, ragpickers, street children, etc. \\n• Families of those who work as daily wage labourers or are \\nseasonal workers, who have no employment and are destitute. \\n• Displaced populations usually in the case of any sudden impact \\ndisaster, such as an earthquake or a flood-like situation, threat or conflict, etc.\\nIn addition to these social categories, two classes of children are particularly vulnerable. \\n1. Girl children- Across the country, we note that boys are given preference \\nover girls whether in feeding or health care-seeking for any illness. Girl \\nchildren are therefore particularly vulnerable and you must ensure that \\nyour visits to homes with girl children also highlights the importance of equal non-discriminatory behaviour in addition to other support that you \\nprovide. \\n2. sick children- Low birth weight children, malnourished children, \\nchildren discharged from SNCU/NRC, children sick due to any childhood \\nillnesses, children with feeding disorders, \\netc. have compromised growth, are prone to repeated infections and \\ntherefore need particular attention.\\nYou have already learnt regarding ‘the eiGht -Fold Path’, for \\nidentifying the vulnerable and marginalised population and your role \\nin each of the steps listed. \\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_21': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child21\\nAs the ASHA and a member of the community you know the families who fall in the category of being \\nvulnerable and marginalised. Your prime focus should be on children belonging to such families who \\nare the most vulnerable and likely to be unreached. \\n 1. mapping\\nYou have already mapped children under five years of age within your \\npopulation. Ensure that a list of all those families which fall in the categories of being vulnerable and marginalised (as discussed above) having \\nchildren from 3 months to 15 months of age is prepared and updated on a  \\nroutine basis.\\n 2. Prioritizing\\nUnder HBYC, you are required to make quarterly home visits to all children between 3 months to 15 \\nmonths of age. However, due to specific constraints, children belonging to vulnerable and marginalised households may get missed. You need to make extra efforts to ensure \\nthat children from such families are not missed. Once you have mapped \\nall children eligible for HBYC in your population, you will particularly focus on vulnerable and marginalised-families having girl child, where \\nchildren have not registered at the Anganwadi centre, families that do \\nnot visit the Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND)/Urban Health Nutrition Day (UHND) sessions, where a previous child death has occurred, where children are malnourished, where children have not \\nbeen identified or admitted for nutritional rehabilitation due to lack of \\nprompt access to healthcare services, children discharged from SNCU or NRC, families where children fall ill frequently or live in unhygienic conditions, etc.\\n 3. Communicating\\nYou should inform the families about why these services are needed, where they are available, and what their health entitlements are. The job-aid and MCP card which will be used as reference material can \\nhelp ensure that you do not miss any important message for the child during the scheduled home-visits.\\n 4. Understanding\\nOften people have a reason or a problem for why they are not able to use health services. Do not \\nassume that their attitudes are bad. You may have to explore options for changing the way existing \\nservices are being provided. You will have to discuss these concerns with your supervisors and bring \\nto their notice. For instance, in some cases, the ANM/MPW will need to make a home visit to provide immunization to the child, or the Anganwadi worker will have to deliver the Take Home Ration (THR) to the household for the child or to record weight and length/height of the child to monitor growth. \\nYou may have to accompany these mothers/ caregivers during VHND/UHND sessions or healthcare \\nfacilities if required, etc.\\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_22': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child22\\n 5. Counselling\\nListen to people’s problems, build a relationship of trust, and \\nwork with them to find solutions. You could accompany them \\nto the VHND/UHND or the health facility so that they feel \\ncomfortable and confident about accessing them on their own in the future. \\n 6. Persisting\\nChanging behaviours is not very easy to do, especially among poor and marginalized families, who may not perceive the immediate gains of your home visits or for whom there are other important \\npriorities. It needs repeated visits and counselling so that these visits are beneficial for proper growth \\nand development of their children. Keep in mind that once the families overcome their reluctance to adopt preventive and promotive health behaviours and begin to access health services, your need for frequent visits will reduce. \\n 7. Coordinating\\nIt is quite likely that there still remain families, who despite your persistent efforts will not access services. You can ask members of the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee \\n(VHSNC), Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS), Self- Help Group (SHG) or request your ASHA Facilitator \\nor the ANM/MPW, who may be in a position to influence these families, to accompany you on a home visit.\\n 8. mobilizing\\nGetting people together gives people the confidence to change. Organization provides strength. Building solidarity creates confidence. Leadership provides inspiration and optimism to break out \\nof age-old inertia. So, organize community meetings, join together to sing songs, take out a rally, and \\ncelebrate survival.

The training helped you to counsel mothers and clear their misconceptions related to breastfeeding. \\nThis section will further reinforce some of these important concepts to counsel families (mothers and \\ncaregivers) during your HBYC visits. \\n4.1.1 WHAT IS Ex CLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING?\\nExclusive breastfeeding means feeding the child onl Y breast \\nmilk for the first 6 months (180 days). Breast milk provides all nutrients and contains sufficient water to meet the requirements of the child up to six months of age; the infants who are exclusively breastfed do not require anything else. \\n4.1.2 ELICITING INFORMATION ABOUT Ex CLUSIVE \\nBREASTFEEDING DURING HOME VISITS\\n• Greet the woman in a kind and friendly way while using the mother’s/caregiver’s and child’s \\nname. \\n• Ask her to tell you about herself and her child in her own way, starting with the things that she feels are important.\\n• To know more about breastfeeding practices, you can ask questions like:\\n ¾What do you feed the child?\\n ¾If child is breastfed, ask how many times in the whole day, the child is breastfed? \\n ¾Is the child given anything other than breast milk (other milk, water, etc.)?\\n• Listen but be careful not to sound critical. Try not to repeat questions. Some mothers/caregivers \\ntell you these things spontaneously. Others will give you information when you empathize and \\nshow that you understand how they feel. Some mothers/caregivers take longer.\\n• Encourage the mother/caregivers to contact you, or the AWW or the ANM/MPW of their area in case of problems related to breastfeeding. \\n4.1.3 IMPORTANT MESSAGES FOR BREASTFEEDING\\nYou may refer to page 10 of MCP card, available with the family for counselling the mother and \\ncaregivers on breastfeeding. \\nYou should reinforce the following key messages to promote breastfeeding amongst the mother/\\ncaregivers:\\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_26': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child26\\n• Early initiation of breastfeeding immediately after birth or definitely within \\n1 hour of birth provides ‘colostrum’ (mother’s first milk) to the newborn that \\nhelps in fighting diseases. Colostrum- the first thick yellowish milk is essential for \\nthe newborn’s nutrition and protection against infections and diseases. This also \\nencourages flow of breastmilk, keeps the newborn warm and promotes bonding between the mother and the newborn. \\n• You may remind the parents that breastmilk helps in better growth of the brain, ensures proper development \\nand improves intelligence, protects against dangerous illnesses, protects \\nagainst obesity, hypertension (blood pressure), diabetes mellitus, etc. during \\nadulthood.\\n• Mother should breastfeed as often as the child wants in day and night. \\nFrequent feeding helps mothers to produce more breastmilk.\\n• Mother should continue breastfeeding even during diarrhoea or any other illnesses to help the child to get optimal nutrition and recover from the illness faster. \\n• Breast feeding mother should eat extra and drink plenty of fluids to provide adequate milk for the child during this time. \\n• Mother should pay attention to/observe early signs of hunger in the child like restlessness, opening mouth and turning head from side to side, putting tongue \\nin and out and sucking on fingers or fists. Crying is a late sign of hunger. Mother \\nshould smile, talk and look into child’s eyes while breastfeeding, encouraging the child to communicate (but not rock the child while breastfeeding). \\nCounsel and reassure the mother in busting the myth that she does not have \\nenough milk for the growing child. Almost all mothers produce enough \\nbreast milk for one or even two children up to 6 months of age. Usually, even when a mother thinks that she does not have enough breast milk, her child is in fact getting all that she/he needs. Build her confidence and support her to breastfeed by increasing the number of times she feeds the child.

LBW infants, sick infants and \\nmalnourished children have higher risk of early growth retardation, infectious disease, developmental delay and death during infancy and childhood. Such children are \\nusually treated in facilities like SNCUs, NBSUs and NRC \\nas they need specialised healthcare by trained service \\nproviders. \\nYou need to explain that low birth weight, sick and malnourished infants may have feeding difficulties \\ninitially because they are weak or sick, get tired easily and thus their intake is poor. They may also have additional problems like difficulty in swallowing, vomiting, or abdominal distension.\\nDuring your home visits to families having sick children, \\nLBW infants and malnourished children, explain the \\nmother/caregiver that these children have higher nutritional needs than normal children. Explain the \\nmothers/caregivers to:\\n• Breastfeed several times a day, every two-three hours, \\neven during the night. \\n• Stroke on sides of the lips and the upper part of the chin to wake up a sleeping child for feeding. \\n• Feed expressed breast milk (EBM) using a cup, katori, paladai and spoon in \\ncase they are unable to feed directly from the breast. \\n• Put to breast to allow them to lick the nipple and try to suckle. Once \\nthe child is able to suckle, child should be put to the breast as often as possible to stimulate milk production. \\n• Use Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) to prevent hypothermia; KMC \\nprovides skin-to-skin contact, warmth and closeness to the \\nmother’s breast. Fathers can also practice Kangaroo Care. \\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_28': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child28\\n4.2 ComPlement ArY FeedinG\\n4.2.1 COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING- WHY START COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING ON \\nCOMPLETION OF SIx MONTHS OF AGE AND CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING?\\nChildren should be introduced to semi-solid, soft foods (complementary \\nfeeding) on completion of six months of age because:\\n• Breast milk alone is not sufficient to meet the growing needs of the \\nchild. \\n• 6 months to 24 months is a period of rapid growth and development \\nin the young child and demands extra nutrition. \\nBreastfeeding should be continued:\\n• For a minimum of 2 years or beyond because it is an \\nimportant source of nutrition, provides energy and \\nprotection from illness. \\n• It protects infants from infection, who are particularly vulnerable during the transition period when complementary feeding begins.\\nBreastfeeding Complementary \\nfeeding\\nremember \\n• To counsel that all children- both girls and boys from birth to 6 months need to be breastfed on demand, both day and \\nnight-at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. \\n• To use your skills learnt during your training in ASHA \\nModule-6 and 7, to correct the position for breastfeeding, address common breastfeeding problems and common \\nreasons for decreased/stopping breastfeeding, teaching \\nexpressing milk by hand and feeding the expressed milk. \\n• To reassure the family members and seek their support for the mother in providing additional care to low birth weight baby. \\n• To advise mother regarding storage of Expressed Breast Milk (EBM):\\n ¾Can be kept in a covered container at room temperature for up to 6 hours. \\n ¾Milk not fed to the infant within 6 hours of expressing should be discarded.\\n ¾Can be stored in the main compartment of a regular refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) for 24 hours.\\nDuring your home visits, ensure that the mother continues to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months.', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_29': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child29\\n4.2.2 REQUIREMENTS OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS\\n1. timely\\nIntroduced at completion of six months when requirement for energy and nutrients exceeds that \\nprovided by breastmilk alone.\\n2.

The child is unable to reach his/her full potential both physically and \\nmentally.\\n4.3.2 CAUSES OF NUTRITIONAL ANAEMIA IN CHILDREN\\nBreastmilk is sufficient to meet the iron requirement of a breastfed child until 6 months of age. Iron \\nfrom breast milk is more easily available to the young child. The onset of anaemia in young children \\nis generally after 6 months of age and increases from 6–8 months till the child is 1 year old. The \\ncommon causes of nutritional anaemia are:\\n• Low iron stores at birth due to anaemia in mother.\\n• Non-exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age.\\n• Too early introduction of inappropriate complementary food i.e. before completion of 6 months \\nof age (resulting in diminished breast milk intake, insufficient iron intake, and heightened risk of \\nintestinal infections).\\n• Late introduction of appropriate (iron-rich) complementary foods i.e. later than completion of 6 \\nmonths of age.\\n• Insufficient quantity of iron and iron enhancers in diet (foods rich in Vitamin C) and low availability of dietary iron (especially from vegetarian diet).\\n• Iron loss due to parasite load (e.g. malaria, intestinal worms).\\n• Poor environmental sanitation, unsafe drinking water and inadequate personal hygiene leading to frequent illnesses.\\nTable 4: Haemoglobin levels to diagnose anaemia (g/dl) \\nAge group Anaemia\\nmild moderate severe \\nChildren 6–59 months of age 10–10.9 7–9.9 <7\\nSource: World Health Organization (WHO) -Nutritional Anemia: Tools for Effective Prevention and Control, 2017.

Often families migrate for livelihood and children belonging to these families miss out on vaccination. \\n• Unreached population-  There are usually the vulnerable or marginalised populations (the \\ncategories belonging to such families has been taught in social vulnerability section) who do not know about immunization or face socio-economic barriers to utilize health services. \\n• Geographic barrier-  People living too far away from a health centre or outreach site are unable \\nto travel long distances and face challenges in completing a full immunization schedule for children.\\n• resistant population-  Families do not believe in immunization services, even though a health \\ncentre is within reach, as there is fear of side effects, etc. \\n• missed opportunities-  Seen in case of children who visit the health centre for some other reason \\nbut are not screened for immunization by health workers.\\n• Cultural or religious reasons- There is refusal of vaccination due to myths, rumors and misconceptions prevalent in few sections of the society.\\n• Gender barrier- Sometimes women are not allowed to attend sessions by their family members. Also, if it is a girl child, family members may not give importance to her vaccination. \\n• Financial barrier-  Sometimes families do not attend immunization sessions because of wage \\nloss, etc.\\n• Fear of Adverse effects Following immunization (Ae Fi)- Fear of AEFI is also a major cause of \\nrefusal of vaccines. \\n5.2.3 R OLE OF ASHA IN IMPROVING IMMUNIzATION COVERAGE\\n• Continue to enumerate all households in your service area and make a list of children up to two years eligible for different vaccines. Update this list regularly to ensure inclusion of new families having children \\nbelow 15 months of age. \\n• Check the immunization status of the child from the MCP card- \\nwhether child has received age-appropriate vaccines during the home visits. \\n• Praise and encourage the family for ensuring their child’s immunization \\nif all necessary vaccines have been given. Identify family constraints/\\nreasons for missed immunization and support or counsel to address \\nthe same. \\n• Inform when and where the family can take the child for the next vaccination, for a missed vaccine, \\nor if a vaccine is due soon. \\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_47': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child47\\nAddress common concerns related to immunization\\nYou need to counsel mothers and caregivers that- \\n• A mild illness is usually not a reason to reschedule vaccinations \\n• The child may still be vaccinated even if he or she has: \\n \\uf077 A low-grade fever (less than 100 degrees) \\n \\uf077 A cold, runny nose or cough \\n \\uf077 Ear infection \\n \\uf077 Mild diarrhoea \\n•  ANM/MPW or the Medical Officer at PHC or UPHC can determine if the child can be vaccinated \\nin case of mild illness.\\n• After a vaccination, the child may cry a little, but that usually settles soon with a feed or some comfort provided by the family member. \\n• Common, minor side-effects such as a slight fever, pain, swelling or redness at the site of the injection and irritability are normal and usually resolve without any serious consequences. Extra fluids, rest and paracetamol medicine when necessary helps the child recover soon from the effects of immunization. However, if other reactions or changes in the child’s body are noted, it is a matter of concern, and the child must be referred immediately to the health facility. • Pay special attention to include children from families who are vulnerable or marginalised, sick, LBW and malnourished infants. Joint visits may be undertaken with ASHA Facilitators and ANMs/MPW to mobilize these children for immunization. \\n• Ensure effective mobilization of children for immunization sessions during VHND/UHND session or at the health facilities.

Length is \\nrecorded for children less than 2 years of age and height for children above 2 years of age. Growth \\nis measured in terms of changes in weight with respect to age, length or height of children. Growth \\nmonitoring helps in visualising change in weight over a period of time with respect to age, length/height of the child and helps to identify if the child is growing adequately or not. Recording of child’s \\nweight should be done once every month up to age of 3 years and at least once in 3 months, thereafter. \\nLength is to be recorded once in three months from birth to 2 years of age and height once in 6 \\nmonths (2 years to 5 years of age). There are separate growth charts for girls and boys, as they have \\ndifferent weights and lengths/heights beginning at birth and grow to different sizes according to age. These are available in the MCP card.\\nThese changes are useful in giving advice to the mother about the growing pattern of the child. This \\nprocess is called ‘GROWTH MONITORING’. You are already familiar with growth monitoring from your training in ASHA Module 7. \\nOptimal growth and development of the child can be \\nensured only with adequate food, absence of illness and a caring, nurturing and social environment. \\nMaximum growth happens in the first two years of \\nlife. A healthy child approximately doubles the birth weight at 5th month and is three times the birth \\nweight by the first birthday. By the end of second \\nyear, the weight is 4 times the birth weight. We must \\nunderstand that weight gain is not the only way to \\nassess a child’s growth. Increase in length or height of the child is also included in the growth pattern of the \\nchild. However, changes in child’s length are slower \\nthan the weight. At the time of birth, the baby’s length is around 50 cm. Expected gain in length in the first \\nyear after birth is 25 cms and in the second year is 12 \\ncms, contributing to a total increase of 37 cms length/\\nheight in the first two years of life.\\nThe A WW uses the growth chart for monitoring growth for every child, separately available for girls \\nand boys. Every child in the village, should be weighed and her/his weight be plotted on the growth \\nchart according to the age of the child. In addition, the length/height of the child will also be recorded \\nin the growth chart given for weight-for-length/height. The AWW will be responsible for recording weight and length/height of the child during VHNDs/UHNDs, or the ANM/MPW can also record the \\nweight and length/height of the child in the SC or during outreach sessions.\\nAs part of your HBYC visits, you need to ensure that the weight and length/height of the child is \\nrecorded by the AWW and details are made available to the mother/caregiver by the AWW either 28 29\\nyr.\\ngrowth CurvesWeight (kg)GoodNormal\\nModerately  \\nUnderweight  \\n(Below - 2SD to - \\n3SD)\\nSeverely  \\nUnderweight  \\n(Below - 3SD)\\nTalk to the  \\nAWW/ANM  \\nimmediatelyDangerous\\nVery Dangerous\\nyr.BirthAge (completed weeks, months and years)\\nServices at Anganwadi Centre\\nSupplementary nutritional support, growth \\nmonitoring and promotion\\nNutrition and health educationGIRL: Weight-for-age - Birth to 3 years \\n(As per WHO Child Growth Standards)\\nyrs. yrs.\\nyrs.\\nyrs.\\nensure equal care for the girl childthe First three years are Forever\\nAnganwadi CentreParticipate in Anganwadi Centre Activities\\nPromote Universalisation with Qualtiy\\nAnganwadi Centre of MWCD, GOI, reaches out to young children under 6 years, \\npregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and women 15-45  years with an \\nintegrated package of services\\nContact your AWW for child care services at the nearest AWC\\nImmunization Early childhood care and \\npreschool education\\nHealth check-up\\nReferral services\\n28 29\\n 30 31\\ngrowth CurvesWeight (kg)GoodNormal\\nModerately  \\nUnderweight  \\n(Below - 2SD to - \\n3SD)\\nSeverely  \\nUnderweight  \\n(Below - 3SD)\\nTalk to the  \\nAWW/ANM  \\nimmediatelyDangerous\\nVery Dangerousyr.\\nyr.BirthBOY: Weight-for-age - Birth to 3 years \\n(As per WHO Child Growth Standards)\\nyrs. yrs.\\nyrs.\\nyrs.\\nAge (completed weeks, months and years)\\nServices at Anganwadi Centrethe First three years are Forever\\nAnganwadi CentreParticipate in Anganwadi Centre Activities\\nPromote Universalisation with Qualtiy\\nImmunization Early childhood care and preschool educationHealth check-up\\nReferral services\\nHave your child weighed at the AWC every month\\n30 31Supplementary nutritional support, growth \\nmonitoring and promotion\\nNutrition and health education\\nAnganwadi Centre of MWCD, GOI, reaches out to young children under 6 years, \\npregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and women 15-45  years with an \\nintegrated package of services\\nContact your AWW for child care services at the nearest AWC\\n32 33\\nWeight (kg)\\nLength/height (cm)-3-2-1 0 1 2 3\\n45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120246810121416182022242628303234\\n246810121416182022242628303234Weight-for-length/height Girls\\n(As per WHO Child Growth Standards)\\n32 33\\nLength/height (cm)Weight (kg)34 35-3-2-1 0 1 2 3\\n45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 120246810121416182022242628303234\\n246810121416182022242628303234Weight-for-length/height Boy\\n(As per WHO Child Growth Standards)\\n34 35\\n Length/height (cm)Weight (kg)', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_49': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child49\\nin MCP card or other mechanism as specified by your district or State.

It is a sign that something is wrong with the child and immediate action must be taken to restore growth. Monitoring or measuring growth \\nregularly is important to see whether the child is growing properly. \\nBy joining the weight dots on the growth chart, the curve (called growth curve) on the growth chart \\ncan be understood. The direction of the growth curve indicates the progress of the child and is helpful in providing appropriate counselling and initiating necessary actions such as referral etc. for malnourished children. \\nTable 7 – Interpretation of growth curve \\nGood - Upward curve dangerous- Flat curve Very dangerous-\\ndownward curve\\nThe curve is moving upwards.\\nIndicates adequate weight \\ngain for the age of the child. The child is growing well and is healthy. \\nThe curve is flat, but has not gone down to another colour band.\\nIndicates that the child is not gaining \\nweight and is not growing adequately. This is called stagnation. The child needs extra attention of the mother. Also, the cause needs to be investigated. Talk to AWW/ ANM (MPW) immediately. Such children should be taken to a 24X7 PHC/UPHC or higher facility for a medical consultation.\\nThe curve is moving down, into another colour band.\\nIndicates loss of weight. \\nTalk to AWW/ANM (MPW) immediately. Child may be severely underweight and she/he needs urgent specialised medical care and immediate referral. \\nPraise, and assess feeding to reinforce the good practices of the mother/caregiver.Review feeding, praise what she is doing well and identify feeding problems, if any and give appropriate feeding advice for bringing about change. Check for any episode of illness. Take corrective action. Follow-up for compliance.Follow- up after 5 days to ensure compliance.\\nYou have already learnt in ASHA Module- 7, on how to check for nutritional oedema of both feet. To check for oedema (swelling due to fluid retention), grasp the foot so that it rests in your hand with your thumb on top of the foot. Press your thumb gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. The child has oedema if a pit (dent) remains in the foot when you lift your thumb. This is one of the ways to detect children with severe malnutrition in the community. Such children will require prompt hospitalisation in a centre which manages such children. This is often the District Hospital.

These are what most babies do, parenting tips for children and “warning” signs.\\nYou will undertake the following activities during the household visits to support the early \\nchildhood development-\\na. Help the mother/caregivers understand what most babies do at a specific age-This is \\ndone by using the MCP card section on ‘What most babies do’ (page 12-21), to track progress on development milestones of the child. There are certain milestones that have been given for 2-3 \\nmonths to 15-18 months of age children.\\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_65': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child65\\nb. teach the mothers/caregivers to undertake milestone assessment-   You will need to teach \\nmothers and caregivers the right method to observe and elicit information for various milestones \\nat a particular age. This is explained in detail in the Learning Tool for \\nMilestone Assessment (LTMA) that is included as Annexure-4 in the \\nhandbook. You will use this tool to teach the mother and caregivers to conduct an assessment for the milestones achieved by the child at a particular age. The tool provides details of normal milestones/ expected activities that are undertaken by the child at a particular age, what are the ways to observe these milestones and warning signs that require \\nreferral. You will need to teach the mother/caregiver, age-specific \\nmilestone assessments prior to your scheduled HBYC visit for the particular age group. For example- To assess the milestone assessment by mother/caregiver at 3 months, you will have to teach them the assessment during your 42nd day of HBNC visit or any other in-between contact with the family. \\nLikewise, for assessment at 6 months, you will need to inform mother/caregiver about milestone \\nassessment for this age-group during your 3rd month household visit. Such a pattern will be required for subsequent age groups till 15 months of age of the child. \\nc. demonstrate the use of local toys/items to elicit information on \\nmilestones- The LTMA mentions using a set of commonly available \\nitems for teaching the mothers/caregivers conduct age-specific \\nmilestone assessment for the child. These items are easily available, \\nlocally in your village/slum area and can be collected while planning your HBYC visits to demonstrate use of these items to the mothers and caregivers. The items required for ECD screening is given in Annexure-3.\\nd. inform mothers/caregivers to record observations in the mCP Card- Once the mothers/\\ncaregivers have learnt to conduct the age specific milestone assessment for their child, you \\nwill inform them to record their observations for each activity in the child’s MCP card on the first day that their child performs these activities. For the child who is able to perform the age specific activity, the parents/caregivers will need to a provide a tick mark (√) against the specific activity in the MCP card. For any activity that the child is unable to perform the parents/ \\ncaregivers will leave the box blank ( \\n ) in the MCP card for the activity concerned. You will \\nexplain the mothers/caregivers that they should not worry or panic even if the child is unable \\nto perform some of these activities at the specific age mentioned in the MCP card because each \\nchild is unique and not all children develop at the same rate. Timings of development milestone \\ncould vary from child to child. Some children show an interest or skills in an activity earlier \\nthan others or later than others. Some children develop very early, such as learning how to \\nwalk or talk much earlier than other children of the same age. Thus, at any circumstance a mother/caregiver is not  expected to a put a cross mark ( X ) in the blank box ( \\n ) provided in \\nthe MCP card against these activities.\\n Do not forget to inform the mother/caregiver that the MCP card will serve as a photo-album for their child. They should preserve it because it is the health record for the child and she/he will find it interesting and will be happy to see her/his developmental journey later in life. \\n', 'Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English_66': 'HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD\\nAdditional Home Visits to Address the Young Child66\\ne. Verify the milestone assessment records undertaken by mothers/caregivers- You or \\nthe AWW during the home visits, will verify the milestones by examining the child for all the activities as listed for a particular age of the child. In the MCP card, in ‘what most babies do’ \\nsection, there is a row where you will record your findings after confirming the activities \\nbeing undertaken by the child. After making the observations, you will provide a tick mark (√) in the box if all the activity milestones for that particular age are being conducted by the child and mark cross (X) on the card, even if one activity is not achieved by the child at that particular age. The (X) sign should be put only after you have assessed and ensured that child had cooperated well, is otherwise active but is still unable to perform the  \\nparticular activity.\\n After making the observations for a particular age group, before leaving the household, do not forget to teach the mother/caregiver, the methods to observe and elicit information for milestone assessments for the subsequent age group.\\nf. While verifying the records if the box provided for the mother/caregiver is left blank- You must confirm whether the mother/caregiver has not marked a tick (√) because she/he has \\nmissed recording the particular activity or the child is unable to perform this activity. If any \\nactivity for milestone assessment has not been assessed by the mother/caregiver, explain them again the importance of conducting these activities with the child. You should then conduct the assessment for the child and provide a tick mark (√) against that activity if the child is able to \\ndo the activity concerned. If not, a cross sign (X) will be included in the box and in your next \\nvisit you will follow- up for achievement of that particular milestone which the child was unable to perform. \\ng. look for “warning” signs as provided in the mCP card for each age group of the child and refer the child to Anm (mPW) or AWW or healthcare provider immediately in case you notice \\neven a single ‘warning’ sign.\\n ¾sensitise the parents/caregivers about the “warning” \\nsigns- This is given in the MCP card (page 12-21) and also in \\nthe learning tool for milestone assessment.

Poor hygiene, \\ninadequate quantities and quality of drinking water and lack of sanitation facilities results in deaths \\nfrom preventable diseases. Women and children are the main victims. Various water-borne diseases can occur due to contaminated water such as food poisoning (vomiting and abdominal pain), typhoid, cholera, worm infestation, dysentery, diarrhoea, etc. \\nIn India, the number of deaths in children particularly due \\nto diarrhoea is very high. Diarrhoeal infection is majorly \\ntransmitted through the faecal-oral route. The adjacent \\n‘F-diagram’ illustrates the different routes that the microbes of diarrhoea take from faeces, through the environment to a new person. For example- microbes in faeces on the ground \\nby a well can get into the water system and be drunk by a \\nchild, hands that have not been washed after going to the toilet can carry microbes onto foods, which are then eaten, infecting another child, who gets diarrhoea and spreads more \\nmicrobes.\\nTo accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on sanitation, the \\nGovernment of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) on 2nd October, 2014.\\n7.2 PromotinG W Ater, sAnit Ation And hYGiene PrACtiCes \\ndUrinG hoUsehold Visits \\nHand-washing is one of the most effective way for reducing water- borne diseases, infections like common cold, flu, pneumonia, etc. Germs can get onto hands through various ways- after people use the toilet, touch any object that has germs on it because someone coughed or sneezed on \\nit or was touched by some other infected object.

Teach the steps of hand-washing to the mother/caregivers and \\neducate families on when and why to regularly wash hands as described in the section given above. Pay special attention to teach hand-washing to families reporting frequent episodes of childhood \\nillnesses. \\n2. Create awareness in the community about the importance of \\nfollowing safe WASH practices, inform them on the ways to achieve them and increase community demand for improved water supply, sanitation facilities and maintaining hygiene. Special emphasis \\nneeds to be given to households that have girl child, live in remote \\nareas, vulnerable/marginalized populations, flood prone districts/areas, etc.\\n3. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), you may be the ‘Sanitation Messengers’ or ‘Swachhata Doots’ for attaining sanitation in your community and motivate households (particularly having young children), who do not have toilets for construction of toilets. This will result in the household \\nmoving away from open defaecation, thus limiting the spread of water-borne diseases. \\n4.  For creating demand and achieving safe WASH practices in the community and particularly for \\nhouseholds having young children, you may work closely with platforms like VHSNC/MAS, gram panchayat members, self-help groups, urban local bodies, religious organizations, AWWs, ANMs/\\nMPW, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), representatives from department of drinking \\nwater and sanitation, municipal corporations, community members, etc. to construct toilets at household and community level, safe disposal of faeces, improving water supply and sanitation facilities in the community, ensuring availability of dustbins and timely collection of waste disposal to control the spread of diseases. \\n5.  Be involved in disseminating information to the community members regarding the ‘VISHWAS’ \\n(Village based Initiative to Synergise Health, Water and Sanitation) campaign for improving \\nwater, sanitation and hygiene situation and its impact on health and quality of life at the community level. You along with the ANM/MPW and AWW will communicate the date, time and venue of campaign day to village community, all VHSNC members, and the teachers and students of school and children in anganwadi, preferably about seven days before the campaign day and \\narrange information, education and communication materials required to conduct such large \\nvillage level campaign. This will encourage community participation and help disseminate information to the community regarding the importance of safe WASH practices. \\nYou must practice the steps of hand-washing during each visit.

You have been selected by your community \\nto serve as a resource because you understand their needs, their beliefs and \\npractices, the social factors, where the poor and needy live, and what people \\nwant from health services. You already know a lot about the community in which you live. However in order to be an effective resource, you need \\nadditional knowledge and skills. You need to learn about health rights and \\nentitlements, the causes and treatment of common illnesses, and type of treatment available at different facilities. You need to develop the skills to \\ncommunicate health related information to people in the community, to \\ncounsel them on prevention of illness and to adopt healthy behaviours, to treat minor ailments and the leadership ability to help people negotiate access to \\nrights and entitlements. \\nThis book is the first in a series of books that will help you do this. As a new \\nentrant to the ASHA programme, this book provides you with a basic level of \\nknowledge and skills to enable you to start your work. After you have grasped \\nthe contents of this book and have applied your new knowledge in your community, additional rounds of trainings will follow, in which you will not only \\nlearn many new things but also get more information on topics that you will \\nlearn in this book. Your community is also an important source of knowledge. Use the knowledge and skills that you get from your books, to build on your \\nlearning from the community, so that you can offer help to the people. That \\nis why your training is conducted for a short duration and allows you time to practice your new skills in the community. After this training, you will be \\nassessed and get a basic certification in communication and social mobilisation. \\nThe next level of certification is after four rounds of training and this will enable you to address issues in care of mothers, newborns and children. As your skill \\nlevel improves, additional certification will be available.

Home visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or five days \\na week, you should visit the families living in your community. If it is a large \\narea, then you will have a certain number of allocated households. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, \\nfamilies will come to you when there is a problem and you will not have to \\ngo so often to their houses. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, you should visit \\nthe families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the \\nhouse, a series of seven visits or more becomes essential.\\n2. Attending the Urban Health and Nutrition Day (UHND): On one day \\nevery month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide \\nantenatal care, immunisation and other services in the area, you, as the ASHA will promote attendance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM \\nservices and help with service delivery.\\n3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman \\nsick child or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort.  \\nThe visit could also be to attend a training programme or review meeting.

Be especially kind to those who are sick, it is more important than a \\nmedicine. Try not to refuse your services to any individual who really needs \\nthem. \\nTreat everybody equally:  Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or \\nhis class, caste, sex and religion. As a health worker your concern is well being \\nof all the individuals not just those you know well or who come to you or \\nwho are the better off and powerful. Inequalities in our society deprive many \\nsections of community from health care services. These are the marginalised people and include those who come from extremely poor families, live in \\ninaccessible or distant part of our community, belong to scheduled caste/\\nscheduled tribe families, have only women in their households and are disabled or handicapped. Treating everybody equally also means spending more time \\nand effort on those whose needs are more.\\nBe responsible: Be responsible to your designated duties and never misuse \\nyour authority for your benefit or for the benefit of friends and relatives \\nRespect people’s traditions and ideas:  People are slow to change their \\nattitudes and traditions and are true to what they feel is right. Rather than \\ninsisting that they adopt your approach, you must try to build on their existing \\nknowledge with your ideas. For example-you can promote the use of modern \\nmedicine together with the traditional methods and the combination may serve better than either one alone. Thus, you can promote the use of ORS for \\ntreating a child with diarrhoea but at the same time encourage mothers to use \\ntraditional preparation like rice water, coconut water to overcome dehydration.\\nKeep learning: Use every chance you get to increase your own knowledge \\neither through reading books, or attending training programmes or asking \\nquestions. \\nBe a role model:  If you want people to take part in improving their area and \\ncare for their health, you must be a role model and practise healthy habits and \\nbehaviours. This way you will earn people’s trust and confidence.

An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling \\namong group members after the meeting \\nhas been a djourned.

But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. \\nHow to handle difficult situations\\nIf you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and \\nreview the options.

As \\nan ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these \\ndifferences to achieve the larger goals of health programmes. You will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to fulfil your \\nresponsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to negotiate \\nwith people in authority but with enough preparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situation which requires negotiation. \\nThe steps of Successful Negotiation\\nl Ask for the other person’s perspective: In a negotiating situation use \\nquestions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. \\nSome examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? \\nWhat are your concerns about what I am suggesting/asking? When you hear \\nthe other person express their needs or concerns, use appropriate listening \\nresponses to make sure you heard correctly. \\nl State Y our needs: In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but \\nalso why you need it. \\nl Prepare options beforehand: Before entering into a negotiation, prepare \\nsome options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not \\nacceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and \\nbe prepared to counter the same with an alternative.

Arguing is about \\ntrying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation \\nwhen each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. \\nIf you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a power struggle. \\nl Consider timing: There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on \\neither side, a preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or \\ntiredness on one side or the other. \\nSuggestions for effective negotiation \\nWhile negotiating as an ASHA you must be patient. Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to \\nunderstand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not \\nbegin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. \\nApproach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal \\nnegotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ \\nYou may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. \\nHow to use your negotiation skills effectively?\\nIn your community you may come across several issues that require to be \\naddressed.

In most of the cases, for gaining strength and ensuring growth a simple nutritious home cooked meal is enough.\\nAvoiding self-medication\\nPeople often buy medicines by themselves or use any medicines lying in the house for \\nconditions such as fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headaches. This should not be \\ndone. Most drugs cause side effects, and some are harmful. The side effects of some of \\nthe commonly used medicines used in self-medication are:\\nl Drugs used as pain killers: Almost all painkillers cause irritation of stomach and many of these, when taken over long periods, can cause internal bleeding and \\nstomach ulcers.\\nl Anti-allergic drugs: Are used in the treatment of cold and cough and can cause \\nsleepiness, which can sometimes cause accidents.\\nl Antibiotics: Antibiotics might cause life-threatening ‘reactions’ if a person is allergic to \\nthem. Some antibiotics can disturb intestinal bacteria and induce diarrhoea.\\nMany drugs affect our vital organs, like the liver and the kidney as these organs flush out drugs and toxins from our body. Some people also treat children with the same medications which have been prescribed to adults. This is dangerous since children \\nneed much smaller doses. Doses are given according to the body weight. Most \\nimportantly, pregnant women should not take any medicine without consulting a qualified doctor, as these could harm the unborn baby. \\nTaking correct dose of medicines\\nBoth overdose and inadequate dosage can be harmful, especially in children. People \\nshould strictly adhere to dosage and schedule of drugs as recommended by the doctor. \\nEducation about rational drug use in community will help you in your work.

Prompt first aid can help nature heal small wounds and deal with germs. \\nBleeding is usually limited to oozing and is due to damage to minute blood \\nvessels. Even these types of wounds need to be attended immediately as they may get contaminated and become infected.\\nTake the following steps while managing these wounds:\\nl Wash your hands using soap and water\\nl Clean the wound, using pre boiled and cold water (Soap can be used if the \\nwound is contaminated with dirt. But remember excess soap may damage \\nthe flesh.) \\n Or,  gently w ipe the dirt away using cotton without rubbing it. Rubbing \\ndisturbs the clot and restart bleeding, thus delaying the healing process.

If a person gets a cut, scrape or wound,  \\nhe/she should be referred immediately to take Tetanus Toxoid injection.\\nFamily members should be warned to:\\nl Avoid using animal or human faeces or mud on a wound. These can \\ncause dangerous infections, such as tetanus.  \\nl Never put alcohol, tincture of iodine, or any medicine directly into a wound; doing so will damage the flesh and make healing slower.\\nl Avoid disturbing the scab (a dry covering over the wound) that has been formed.\\nl Visit a health facility if there is a deep/sharp cut for which stitches may be needed. \\n Refer persons to nearby health facility immediately in case the cut is large.\\n2. Care of the wound with bleeding: \\nMinor bleeding is readily controlled by pressure and elevation. In such cases a \\nsmall ashesive dressing is all that is necessary. Medical aid need only be sought \\nif the bleeding does not stop or if the \\nwound is at special risk of infection. \\nSteps to control severe external bleeding from wound: \\nl Raise the injured part\\nl Apply pressure on the wound directly by using \\nyour fingers or palm preferably over a clean sterile \\ncloth/bandage. \\nl Hold the pressure.

It is rarely life-\\nthreatening.\\nHow does it spread?\\nChikungunya is caused by the chikungunya virus which is spread by the bite of an Aedes mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti. Humans are the major source, or \\nreservoir of chikungunya virus for mosquitoes. Therefore, the mosquito usually \\ntransmits the disease by biting an infected person and then biting someone else. An infected person cannot spread the infection directly to other persons. \\nAedes aegypti mosquitoes bite during the day time.\\nSigns and Symptoms\\nThe time between the bite of a mosquito carrying chikungunya virus and \\nthe start of symptoms ranges from 1 to 12 days. Chikungunya usually starts \\nsuddenly with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash. \\nThe most common feature of the disease is stooped or (contorted) posture of patients who have severe joint pain (arthritis). Frequently, the infection causes \\nno symptoms, especially in children. Recovery from Chikungunya is gradual \\nwith persistent joint pain which may require medications for pain relief.. Managing Chikngunya\\nHow to Confirm?\\nChikungunya is diagnosed by blood tests (ELISA). Since the clinical appearance of both chikungunya and dengue are similar, it is important to do a laboratory \\nconfirmation especially in areas where dengue is common. Facilities of such \\ntesting are available only at few national level institutes. \\nTreating Chikungunya \\nThere is no specific treatment for chikungunya. Supportive therapy that helps \\nease symptoms, such as taking medicines for pain relief like Ibuprofen/brufen non and getting plenty of rest, is advised. \\nPrevention of Vector Borne Diseases \\nAll three vector borne disease discussed above – Malaria , Dengue and Chikanguniya are spread by biting of mosquitoes – Anopheles and Aedes \\nrespectively.

About 46% of the \\nchildren below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly \\none out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under \\nnutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, \\nadolescence and adulthood.\\nFacts about malnutrition in young children\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the \\ncontributory factors to over half of all child deaths.\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they find it more difficult to \\nget healthcare and also there is less time for child care.\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using their \\nscarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition.\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the \\ngrandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue.\\nl\\u2003\\u2003It is easier to prevent a child from slipping into malnutrition than to reverse \\nit once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on counselling \\nevery family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this \\ntime, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.\\nRecognising malnutrition\\nIt is difficult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it is too ', 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English_92': '92\\nInduction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areaslate. Most children look normal but their height and weight when measured \\nis less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child \\nmonthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the \\nchild can be classified as mild, moderate or severely underweight.\\nSick children need special attention. However, families of all children especially \\nchildren below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent \\nmalnutrition.\\nSix important messages for preventing child malnutrition\\n1. Exclusive Breastfeeding\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; not even water should be added.\\n2. Complementary Feeding\\nl\\u2003\\u2003At the age of six months, add other foods. Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least \\none to two years more. There are five things to remember about \\ncomplementary feeding:\\nl\\u2003Consistency: Initially the food has to be so_ and mashed. But later, anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less \\nspices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. \\n‘give daal not daal ka pani’ .\\nl\\u2003Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as \\nthe mother.\\nl\\u2003Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given \\nshould be equal to about half what the adult needs in terms of \\nnutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has \\nto be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day.\\nl\\u2003Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family \\ncould add a spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever \\nedible oil is available in the house is sufficient.\\nl\\u2003Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the greener it is, or the more red it is the more its \\nprotective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, fish are liked by children \\nand very nutritive and protective.\\n3. Feeding during the illness\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Give as much as the child will take; do not reduce the quantity of food. After the illness, to catch up with growth, add an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a \\nmajor cause of malnutrition.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English_93': '93\\nInduction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas4. Prevent illness\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are six important \\nthings to remember which could prevent illness:\\nl\\u2003Hand washing: before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s food, and after cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the \\nsingle most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea. \\nl\\u2003Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of \\nparticular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.\\nl\\u2003Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that \\ncause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are \\nmore common and life threatening, than in normal children.\\nl\\u2003Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and then repeated once every six months till five years of age. This too \\nreduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in \\nmalnourished children. \\nl\\u2003Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during \\nthe illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more \\nrigorous in hand washing and more careful in handling the baby. \\nl\\u2003Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of \\nmalnutrition. You should encourage parents and other family members \\nto spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the \\nchild. Such children eat and absorb food better.\\n5. Access to health services\\nl\\u2003Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. On the \\nvery first day of the illness, if you help the mother decide on whether it is a \\nminor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be referred \\nto a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.\\nl\\u2003Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a \\nmuch higher chance of the children being malnourished.\\n6. Access to anganwadi services\\nl\\u2003The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the age \\nof 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations. \\n', 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English_94': '94\\nInduction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasMalnourished children are to be given additional food supplements. For \\nchildren below the age of two, take – home rations are to be given. Even \\npregnant women and lactating mothers up to six months are entitled to \\nget food supplements in the anganwadi centres. _ Weighing the baby \\nand informing the family of the level of malnutrition is another important \\nanganwadi service. \\nl\\u2003The anganwadi is also the site where the Urban Health and Nutrition Day \\n(UHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is given \\nimmunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) \\npackets or drugs needed for illness management.\\nNote\\nWasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very \\ncostly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally \\navailable nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors \\nfor the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could \\nalso be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.\\nCounselling on Malnutrition\\nAll the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, \\nmany of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not \\nbe possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps; first an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding \\nof this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.\\nFor an analysis, we need to know the following\\nl\\u2003\\u2003What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, \\nmoderately underweight or severely underweight?\\nl\\u2003\\u2003What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?\\nl\\u2003\\u2003What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?\\nl\\u2003\\u2003What is the family’s access to the three key services?

It is a transition period of life \\nwhere an individual is no longer a child, but not yet an adult\\nDevelopmental changes during adolescence\\nAs a part of growing up, adolescents go through puberty. Puberty is the time in life when body changes from that of a child to an adult. These developmental \\nchanges occur under the influence of chemicals in our body called hormones. \\nThe changes are:\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Physical Changes \\n In Girls: The body changes shape by becoming more rounded, the breasts \\ngrow, the hips widen, hair grows in the armpits and private parts. This \\nhappens between 10-16 years of age. The onset of menstruation (bleeding every month) is an important change occurring among girls during the \\nadolescent years.\\n\\u2003 In Boys: The shoulders widen, height increases suddenly, the voice changes \\nand becomes deeper and hair begins to grow in the armpits, private parts \\nand the face.\\nl\\u2003\\u2003Emotional Changes: Include shyness, rapid mood changes, lack of \\nconfidence, attention seeking behaviour, strong peer influence, sexual \\nattraction, desire to establish own identity and independent thinking.

These include: \\nMenstruation in girls\\n(Understanding Menstruation and Problems during menstruation)Menarche: The onset of puberty, when the girl has her first period is called \\nMenarche and generally takes place between 9-16 years of age. During this \\nperiod, most girls have bleeding for the first time from the vagina which becomes a periodic occurrence in a girl’s life. Each cycle of bleeding is observed \\nin a gap of 28-40 days.\\nWhy does menstruation occur?In a girls’ body at puberty, every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of \\nthe eggs from the ovary, travels through pipes called fallopian tube. This is \\ncalled ovulation. As the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a soft spongy lining Note:\\nl The normal time for onset of puberty is 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 years in boys.\\nl  These changes start 1-2 years earlier in girls as compared to boys. The rate and extent of change is variable in different individuals. In a group \\nof individuals who are growing together this variation often leads to \\nanxiety –“Am I normal?” and needs reassurance.\\nl Any cases showing delay, such as- menstruation not starting by 16 years in girls needs referral to a doctor. \\nl Early onset of puberty signs in girls (before eight years) and boys (before nine years) is also a matter of concern and should be referred for further \\nexamination.', 'Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English_111': '111\\nInduction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasgets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of tiny blood vessels. \\nIn case an egg and sperm meet to form an embryo, or a baby, that begins to \\ngrow in the uterus this lining provides the nutrition for the baby. If the egg is \\nnot joined by a sperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The unfertilised egg along with broken uterine lining is released as blood and flows out of \\nthe vagina. This bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called \\nmenstruation.\\nMenstrual Cycle\\nA menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. The typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short \\nas 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which \\ncan vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.\\nProblems faced by girls during menstruation\\nThe difficulties that girls may experience during menstruation are:Irregular Periods: For the first few years of menstruation, cycles are often \\nirregular and usually become regular within two to three years after menarche. \\nThey may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). \\nHeavy periods: Adolescents may have heavy periods lasting longer than eight \\ndays, often saturating the pad within an hour or passing large blood clots.

This cloth is washed and reused most of the time. A sanitary napkin \\nis a pad worn within the underwear during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. Disposable sanitary napkins are more convenient and easier to use than \\nreusable cloth.

It is about a miracle that ordinary \\nwomen were able to achieve collectively. It is about a community of hard-working \\nwomen who laboured in the fields to earn their living. The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the \\nhard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), in \\nexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, they incurred debts or stole household articles like glasses, plates or even their wives’ saris. After \\ndrinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making \\ntheir lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to go straight to these shops in the evening \\nafter returning from work. They came home late at night, completely drunk They \\nwould hand over some money for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his \\nfather to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community \\nalso had an alcoholic husband, when her relatives visited her house they were scared away from the village by the obscene language of her closest neighbour, \\na heavy drinker. She felt ashamed and thought that the village would be a much \\nbetter place without arrack.\\nEveryday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women \\ndiscussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached \\nthe village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders. They expressed their problem and asked them to get remove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the \\nSarpanch, although agreeable, were unable to do anything. The next day one \\nhundred women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come into the village’ , they told the cart driver \\nstrongly in unison and stood in front of it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them \\noffered him a rupee to do so. The driver got scared and left the village.\\nThen a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded \\nthat it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police came to the \\nvillage and said that all those who bid at auctions had the right to sell arrack. The women stood unmoved. They said that they would go to the Collector and would \\nnot keep quiet if arrack was sold in their village. The arrack contractors got cold feet.

The first three sections contain 17 indicators/variables which assess the extent of \\nresidential, social and occupational vulnerability of the household. Section IV \\ncollects the information on the health status and health seeking behavior of the households. Each variable is given three scores as 0,1 and 2. Zero being the \\nlowest/worst case. Then, the cumulative scores are computed and based on \\nthe scores, the household is categorized into one of three categories i.e Most Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable.

Background\\nWhy a programme on Menstrual Hygiene?\\nGood menstrual hygiene is essen/g415  al for the health and dignity of girls and women. \\nDiscussions on menstrual hygiene are important for adolescent girls to clarify exis/g415  ng \\nmyths and misconcep/g415  ons around menstrua/g415  on. Improving menstrual hygiene is \\nimportant from the point of view of personal comfort and increased mobility. It also reduces the likelihood of infec/g415  ons resul/g415  ng from poor hygiene prac/g415  ces during \\nmenstrua/g415  on. Providing girls with knowledge and skills on maintaining menstrual \\nhygiene improves school a/g425  endance among girls, who otherwise may not a/g425  end \\nschool during those days or even drop out of school altogether. \\nHow to promote Menstrual Hygiene? \\nPromo/g415  ng menstrual hygiene is achieved through: \\n/circle6 Provision of health educa/g415  on to girls and women on menstrua/g415  on and \\nmenstrual hygiene\\n/circle6 Increasing community ac/g415  on to improve access to clean toilets with water, both \\nat home and in schools\\n/circle6 Promo/g415  ng the availability and use of sanitary products\\n/circle6 Enabling safe disposal of sanitary products\\nWho can promote Menstrual Hygiene?\\nMenstrual Hygiene can be promoted in the community and in schools. It is best to \\nstart with adolescent girls; although, other women in the reproduc/g415  ve age group \\nwould also beneﬁ  t from the informa/g415  on and access to sanitary products. ASHA, the \\nAnganwadi Workers (AWWs), and the members of women’s Self Help Groups (SHGs) can make a substan/g415  al diﬀ  erence to menstrual hygiene prac/g415  ces in the community.  \\nAs an ASHA, you already have the advantage of being in close contact with women \\nin the community. This will be helpful in providing informa/g415  on on menstrual hygiene \\nand sanitary products contained in this booklet to adolescent girls and women in the community. As a member of the Village Health and Sanita/g415  on Commi/g425  ee (VHSC) \\nand in working with members of the Panchayat, you can promote toilets in homes, and ensure separate toilets for girls in local schools. Members of women’s SHGs can support and assist you in encouraging menstrual hygiene and promo/g415  ng the use of \\nsanitary napkins in the community. Sanitary napkins can be made locally by SHGs using a simple technology. You can encourage the groups in your village to take ', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_4': '4 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHA\\nup this ac/g415  vity. Further informa/g415  on is available in the oﬃ   ces of the District Health \\nSociety and the District Collector. \\nII.

Menarche may take place between 9-16 years of age. During this period, most girls observe bleeding for the ﬁ  rst /g415  me from the vagina. This bleeding becomes \\na periodic occurrence in a girl’s life with the cycle of bleeding observed in a gap of 28-40 days.  \\nMenstrua/g415  onWhy does menstrua/g415  on occur?\\nGirls have thousands of eggs in their ovaries when they are \\nborn. Every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of the eggs leaves one of the ovaries, and travels through a fallopian tube. When the egg leaves the ovary, this is called ovula/g415  on. \\nAs the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a so/g332   spongy lining \\ngets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of /g415 ny blood vessels.In case an egg and sperm meet to form an \\nembryo, or a baby, that begins to grow in the uterus and the lining will provide the nutri/g415  on. If the egg is not joined by a \\nsperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The blood that is released from the broken lining, ﬂ  ows out of the vagina. \\nThis bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called menstrua/g415  on.III. About Menstrua/g415  on', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_5': '5 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAA menstrual cycle lasts from the ﬁ  rst day of one period to the ﬁ  rst day of the next. \\nThe typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short as 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which can vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.\\nDays 1-7\\nDays 8-14\\nDays 15-28\\nIf the egg is not fer/g415  lised, the uterus wall  \\ncon/g415  nues to thicken un/g415  l there is a sudden drop \\nin hormone levels. The lining breaks down, and the \\nnext period begins.The period is considered the beginning of the menstrual cycle. \\nA period normally lasts for around ﬁ  ve days, but can be \\nas short as two days or as long as seven. There is usually \\naround 2-6 tablespoons of blood lost during each period, depending on the heaviness of the ﬂ  ow. A period occurs \\nbecause the uterus will shed its lining if an egg (ovum) is not \\nfer/g415 lised.\\nOne of the ovaries releases an egg and the \\nuterus begins to rebuild its lining. Only \\none egg is released in each cycle. The \\negg slowly travels down the fallopian \\ntube from the ovaries towards the uterus. If the egg is fer/g415  lised by a \\nsperm before it arrives the uterus, the girl becomes pregnant.', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_6': '6 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAIV. What are the Problems that a Girl may \\nEncounter During Menstrua/g415  on?\\nThe diﬃ   cul/g415  es that girls may experience during menstrua/g415  on are:\\n1. Irregular periods2. Heavy periods3. Painful periods\\nIrregular Periods : For the ﬁ  rst few years of menstrua/g415  on, cycles are o/g332  en irregular. \\nThey may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). A young girl may even have only three or four periods a year. A girl’s cycles will usually become regular within two to three years a/g332  er menarche. \\nHeavy periods: A heavy period is one which lasts longer than eight days, saturates \\nthe napkin within an hour or includes large clots of blood in the menstrual ﬂ  ow. \\nThis is common in adolescents because of slight imbalance in chemical hormones secreted by the body. However, if this happens regularly, it leaves the girl feeling exhausted; which means that the body is losing more blood than it is producing. The girl should then consult a doctor immediately.\\nPainful period:  Slight pain during periods is quite normal. This is due to the secre/g415  ons \\nof a chemical called prostaglandins in larger quan/g415  ty than normal. This leads to \\nnausea, headaches, diarrhoea and severe cramps. Usually, this lasts only for a day or two. To get relief from these symptoms, a girl should try the following methods:\\n/circle6 Fill a plas/g415  c bo/g425  le with hot water, wrap it in a towel and place it on the \\nabdomen,\\n/circle6 Massage the abdomen \\n/circle6 Local remedies such as ginger tea can be taken\\nPremenstrual Syndrome (PMS):  This refers to a combina/g415  on of physical and \\nemo/g415  onal symptoms experienced by all women during the menstrual cycle, usually \\njust before bleeding begins.

Menstrual Hygiene, Use and Disposal of \\nSanitary Napkins \\nWhat is commonly used by girls and women to absorb \\nmenstrual blood?\\nGirls and women use diﬀ  erent ways to absorb menstrual blood. One of the most \\ncommon methods used is a cloth which is folded and placed within the underwear, or passes over the private parts by means of a string /g415  ed around the waist. This cloth \\nis washed and reused most of the /g415  me. Key Messages \\nc.  Painful or heavy feeling in the breasts d.  Feelings of irritability \\nThese symptoms begin ﬁ  ve to seven days before the period starts and disappear \\nbefore the bleeding begins. This can be managed with remedies for pain described above and ea/g415  ng a diet that is low in salt, and includes foods like leafy green \\nvegetable and raw fruits and vegetables, which are low in sugar and high in ﬁ  bre.\\n', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_8': '8 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAO/g332 en the cloth is not washed properly, without soap and using very li/g425  le water. Many \\ngirls are embarrassed about drying the cloth under the sun (where it can be seen by others). Therefore, the cloth stays damp and this can give rise to skin infec/g415  ons. \\nWhat is a sanitary napkin?\\nA sanitary napkin is a pad that is worn during menstrua/g415  on to absorb the ﬂ  ow \\nof blood. The sanitary napkin is to be used by the girl during her periods (when the blood is ﬂ  owing) so that it can help her carry out normal work without any \\ndiscomfort. Sanitary napkins are disposable and should be discarded a/g332  er being used \\nonce. You can obtain a stock of sanitary napkins and store it for distribu/g415  on to girls. \\nThe sanitary napkin has three layers: \\n/circle6 The lowest layer that lies on the underwear. \\n/circle6 The middle layer which soaks the blood quickly and prevents leakage.\\n/circle6 A surface layer that is close to the skin. It is made of perforated material that \\nkeeps the skin dry and acts as a barrier between the skin and the absorbent panel.\\nThere are two types of napkins: \\n/circle6 Sanitary napkin with an adhesive (s/g415  cky) strip: This napkin has a strip of paper \\non its lowest layer which can be peeled oﬀ  , and the pad can then be stuck to the \\nunderwear. \\n/circle6 Non adhesive sanitary napkin used with or without an underwear: These napkin \\nhave a special elas/g415  c belt or a waist girdle with loops. The pad has an external \\nbag-like covering with long ﬂ  aps that can slide into the loops. \\nWhat are the advantages of sanitary napkins?\\n/circle6 Disposable sanitary napkins are more convenient and easier to use than \\nreusable cloth.\\n/circle6 Since the blood gets absorbed into the middle layer, there is a feeling of dryness. \\n/circle6 When changed o/g332  en, they can prevent infec/g415  on.\\n/circle6 They can be used by women of all age groups.\\n/circle6 They allow girls more mobility and thus can allow them to take part in \\nschool ac/g415  vi/g415 es. \\n', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_9': '9 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAWhat should you do if sanitary napkins are not available \\nimmediately? \\nAlthough a sanitary napkin is a convenient and safe method for maintaining menstrual \\nhygiene, it is possible that one may not be able to get the sanitary napkin in /g415  me. In \\nsuch circumstances, a cloth pad can be used as a subs/g415  tute. Many women use a cloth \\npad wrapped in co/g425  on or folded cloth, which is held by a string between the legs.\\nPoints to remember when using a cloth pad: \\n1. Use clean co/g425  on cloth for making the cloth pads. Pads made of synthe/g415  c ﬁ bre \\nwill not absorb the menstrual ﬂ  uid and cause irrita/g415  on and itching.\\n2. The cloth should be changed 3-4 /g415  mes during the day, in case of a heavy \\nmenstrual ﬂ  ow.\\n3. The used cloth should be washed separately with hot water and soap and dried \\nin the sun. \\n4. If the cloth has to be used again, it must be stored in a dry place. \\nThings to remember about menstrual hygiene\\n/circle6 Once wet, the napkin should be changed immediately. If not it can cause \\nirrita/g415  on on the inside of the thighs and can lead to infec/g415  ons.\\n/circle6 Sanitary napkins should be kept in a clean and dry place.\\n/circle6 It is essen/g415  al to wash the body and private parts daily.\\n/circle6 During menstrua/g415  on, the outer genitals should be washed from /g415  me-to-/g415  me \\nto remove any blood that is le/g332  . Girls should wash their hands every /g415  me they \\nchange the napkin.\\n/circle6 If the underwear is soiled, it must be changed. Otherwise this makes bacteria to \\ngrow and cause infec/g415  on.\\n/circle6 If sanitary napkins are not available, a clean cloth pad should be used.\\n', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_10': '10 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAHow to dispose of sanitary napkins?\\nSafe disposal of sanitary napkins is important. Where there are facili/g415  es for regular \\ngarbage removal, girls should be encouraged to wrap the used napkin in an old newspaper and throw them into dustbins which are emp/g415  ed daily. If garbage is not \\ncollected daily, the napkins should be disposed of by burying them in a deep pit or by burning them. Some schools have machines in which a large quan/g415  ty of napkins \\ncan be burnt. These are called incinerators. However, not all schools have these. Girls should be cau/g415  oned against throwing away used napkins under bushes or out \\nin the open. Sanitary napkins, if collected in one place for a long /g415  me, begin to emit \\nbad odour, and become a site where bacteria can mul/g415  ply. They can also block drains \\nand cause problems with sanita/g415  on. \\nPlanning for menstrual periods\\nOnce menarche sets in, girls should be encouraged to plan for their menstrual \\nperiods. This includes keeping track of their menstrual cycles so that they are prepared for the /g415  me when the bleeding starts. As periods may be irregular in the \\nearly years, girls should be encouraged to be alert for the bleeding. If they are school going girls or plan to be out of home for a long while, they should carry a sanitary napkin with them. \\nVI. Key Ac/g415  vi/g415 es to Promote \\nMenstrual Hygiene\\n(i) Organising monthly mee/g415  ngs on a ﬁ  xed day for adolescent \\ngirls:  One of your responsibili/g415  es is to organise monthly \\nmee/g415  ngs on a ﬁ  xed day at the Anganwadi Centre or Panchayat \\nBhavan for adolescent girls in the target age group of 10-19 years. The day will be ﬁ  xed by the state government and \\nwill be observed throughout the state. The purpose of this ', 'Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA_11': '11 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAmee/g415  ng is to provide health educa/g415  on to girls on issues of menstrua/g415  on and \\nmenstrual hygiene. You should use the ﬂ  ip book provided to you to conduct \\nthis session. The second purpose of this mee/g415  ng is to make sanitary napkins \\navailable to the girls. This can be done through the support of the Anganwadi worker and other members of the women self help groups in the village. The mee/g415  ng should be held in collabora/g415  on with the Kishori Samooh or an \\nAdolescent Resource Centre under the SABLA scheme, where it exists. For this, you will be paid an incen/g415  ve of Rs. 50. These mee/g415  ngs will also serve \\nas venues where informa/g415  on on adolescent-related health can be \\ncommunicated. \\n(ii) Conduc/g415  ng home visits for girls who do not regularly a/g425  end monthly \\nmee/g415  ngs: Monthly mee/g415  ngs should be complemented by household \\nvisits to promote menstrual hygiene among girls and other inﬂ  uencers in \\nthe family, who are unable to a/g425  end the monthly mee/g415  ngs. This would \\nmo/g415 vate a/g425  endance for future mee/g415  ngs. \\n(iii) Using the venue of Village Health and Nutri/g415  on \\nDay and the Village Health and Sanita/g415  on \\nCommi/g425  ee mee/g415  ngs to discuss menstrual \\nhygiene: Apart from girls, other women in the \\nreproduc/g415  ve age group also need informa/g415  on \\non menstrual hygiene. You should use the opportunity to provide this informa/g415  on to women \\nwhen they a/g425  end the VHND at the Anganwadi \\ncentre. The VHSC is also responsible for providing toilets in households and in schools. You should support this process by discussing the importance of toilets for girls in schools as an important component of menstrual hygiene. \\n(iv) Enabling regular availability of sanitary napkins to girls in the age \\ngroup of 10-19 years: You can obtain supplies of sanitary napkins from \\nthe ANM and supply them to girls during the monthly mee/g415  ng. Girls \\nwho are unable to a/g425  end these mee/g415  ngs should be reached through \\nhome visits to ensure supply. Under the scheme, all rural adolescents will be supplied sanitary napkins at a reasonable price which would be ﬁ xed by the government. \\n(v) Maintaining an inventory of the stock and keeping \\naccounts: You will need to es/g415  mate the number of \\npacks required for your village. Thus, you will require a list of girls in the age group of 10-19 years. In order to obtain the list, you can elicit support from the AWW and the members of the SHG. The stock of sanitary napkins can be obtained from the ANM.

Make sure all areas of the house are well lit.\n","3. Get eyesight checked regularly, especially for older people in the house.\n","4. Take proper precautions if any occupational hazards are present at workplace (eg. caution \n","while working with heavy machinery, use of safety guards to prevent injury from thresher and cutter while farming, handling of chemicals, live wires etc.)\n","5. Always stay alert and look in all directions while walking on/crossing roads and streets.\n","6. Always wear seat belt or helmet when traveling in vehicles.\n","7.

Teach children to be safe while playing outdoors.\n","3.2. Burns\n","3.2.1. Recognizing life threatening situation\n","3.2.2. Management Protocol \n","Specific Measures\n","In cases of burns, use the STOP approach:\n","1. S: Strip burnt clothes/jewelry.\n","2. T: Turn on COOL tap and let the burn wash under cool water for at least 10 minutes. \n","3. O: Organize safe referral.\n","4. P: Protect burn with a clean cloth.\n","Caution:\n","Do not apply ice directly over the burn.!!\n","Do not apply any lotions/creams over the burn.!!\n","Do not attempt to remove cloth stuck to the skin that is burnt.!!\n","Do not peel away burnt skin or blisters.!!\n","3.2.3. Safe Referral/Transport\n","As you have been taught before, you should call for help as soon as you identify a life-threatening \n","situation. You need to know the public health facilities nearest to you which provide care for \n","trauma and accident related emergencies. Mapping of all the nearest referral centres should be \n","done and information should be kept handy regarding facilities: \n","i. Which can provide primary care for emergencies like superficial burns etc.\n","ii. Which provide secondary care (where a Medical Officer is present) for burn emergencies. \n","iii. Where specialist doctors are available who can manage emergencies like severe burns etc.\n","17\n","Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 17 1. You need to keep the phone numbers for all available ambulance services handy with you \n","at all times.\n","2. You need to keep the contact numbers of the CHO and MO handy with you at all times.\n","3. You need to stay informed about the facility where the patient has been referred and follow up once he/she is discharged.\n","Table in Annexure II may be used to understand what cases can be treated at which level so that \n","time is not wasted in referring to facility that is not equipped to address the case.\n","3.2.4. Follow-up Care\n","Most cases of extensive burns require care even after discharge from the health facility, for \n","complete recovery. As the ASHA, you will be involved in identifying those patients who have \n","received treatment for burns but require follow-up care either for a short duration until complete \n","recovery or for a longer period of time which is called palliative care. Your role will be to provide follow-up care and providing support to the patient and their family whenever required.  \n","In cases where the patient is a victim of burns, you could provide the following care:\n","Educate the patient on wound care: Major burn wounds usually take a few weeks to heal \n","!!\n","completely. You can ensure that he/she visits the health facility regularly for change in \n","dressing, takes prescribed medicines regularly and follows good hygiene practices.\n","Check for any complication in healing: In case the wound gets infected or healing is !!\n","delayed, the person will develop redness, swelling, fever, foul smell, pain around the \n","wound, pus/discharge etc. If any of these is present, inform them and refer him/her to the \n","nearest SHC-HWC.\n","If any patient has been prescribed/advised physiotherapy, facilitate by mobilizing them to !!\n","the SHC-HWC for the same on designated days.In case a patient develops permanent disability, ensure that he/she receives appropriate \n","!!\n","palliative care. Link him/her with the palliative care services provided through the AB-HWCs.Provide psycho-social support to help the person overcome the crisis.\n","!!\n","3.2.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level\n","Some of the key messages you need to make use of, to educate the community regarding \n","prevention of emergency situations like Burns are:\n","1.\tNever leave children unattended in the kitchen.\n","2.\tAlways switch off stove/oven when not in use.\n","3.\tDo not handle/be careful while handling very hot liquids.\n","4.\tIf any chemical like cleaning acid, lime or alkaline based toilet cleaners etc is there in the \n","house, keep it away safely.\n","5.\tBurns can also be caused by steam, eg. Steam from pressure cookers, etc.\n","Electrocution:\n","1.\tStay alert while using any electrical appliance inside or outside the house\n","2.\tUse of rubber slippers while dealing with live electric wires, sockets etc. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# train_dataset_ll.queries['']"],"metadata":{"id":"7SRpgYrFht5C"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#

We know that during negotiation \n","when each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. \n","If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way.

Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to \n","understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not \n","begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. \n","Approach a negotiation with an attitude of,  “I accept you as an equal \n","negotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ \n","You may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. \n","How to use your negotiation skills effectively?\n","In your community you may come across several issues that require to be \n","addressed.

The VHSNC meeting is a good forum to \n","address such issues.\n","l If this also does not work, try to identify organisations working on the same \n","issue and seek their support.
