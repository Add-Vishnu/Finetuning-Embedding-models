Induction Training Module for ASHA English,4,"Acknowledgements
The Induction Training Module for New ASHAs is a consolidation of the 
contents of the first five ASHA Modules. It represents the hard work of a large 
number of individuals and institutions who were involved in developing 
these modules. Acknowledgements are due to members of the National ASHA Mentoring Group and State Nodal Officers for ASHA and Community Processes, 
who provided valuable insights and feedback for developing this Module. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,5,"What is this Book about?
You have chosen to be an ASHA. You have been selected by your community 
to serve as a resource because you understand their needs, their beliefs and 
practices, the social factors, where the poor and needy live, and what people 
want from health services. You already know a lot about the community in which you live. However in order to be an effective resource, you need 
additional knowledge and skills. You need to learn about health rights and 
entitlements, the causes and treatment of common illnesses, and type of treatment available at different facilities. You need to develop the skills to 
communicate health related information to people in the community, to 
counsel them on prevention of illness and to adopt healthy behaviours, to treat minor ailments and the leadership ability to help people negotiate access to 
rights and entitlements. 
This book is the first in a series of books that will help you do this. As a new 
entrant to the ASHA programme, this book provides you with a basic level of 
knowledge and skills to enable you to start your work. After you have grasped 
the contents of this book and have applied your new knowledge in your community, additional rounds of trainings will follow, in which you will not only 
learn many new things but also get more information on topics that you will 
learn in this book. Your community is also an important source of knowledge. Use the knowledge and skills that you get from your books, to build on your 
learning from the community, so that you can offer help to the people. That 
is why your training is conducted for a short duration and allows you time to practice your new skills in the community. After this training, you will be 
assessed and get a basic certification in communication and social mobilisation. 
The next level of certification is after four rounds of training and this will enable you to address issues in care of mothers, newborns and children. As your skill 
level improves, additional certification will be available. "

What are the Main Roles of the ASHA? 
An ASHA is “ a woman selected by her community, based in her community 
and serves as a resource to her community” . Your role is three-fold: to be 
a facilitator of health services and link people to health care facilities, to 
be a provider of community level health care, and an activist, who builds people’s understanding of health rights and enables them to access their entitlements. Being an ASHASection 1
Didi, which day is the ANM 
coming to our village?
Didi, they are charging me at the 
govt hospital and I don’t have the 
money to pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do 
I have go to the far away town or is 
there something you can suggest?
With continuous training and support, you mature in your role as an ASHA. You 
gain the confidence of the people, make them aware of their health rights and 
gradually start to involve and mobilise the community in local health planning."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,8,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 8Activities of an ASHA 
ASHA’s work consists mainly of five activities:
1. Home visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or five days 
a week, you should visit the families living in your community. If it is a large 
village, then you will have a certain number of allocated households. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, 
families will come to you when there is a problem and you will not have to 
go so often to their houses. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, you should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the 
house, a series of seven visits or more becomes essential.
2. Attending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide 
antenatal care, immunisation and other services in the village, you, as the ASHA will promote attendance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM 
services and help with service delivery.
3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant 
woman or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort.

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,11,"11 Induction Training Module for ASHAsValues of an ASHA
Here are some important values which should guide you in your work: 
Be kind:  Have compassion for people and never be afraid to show that you 
care. Be especially kind to those who are sick, it is more important than a 
medicine. Try not to refuse your services to any individual who really needs them. 
Treat everybody equally:  Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or 
his class, caste, sex and religion. As a health worker your concern is well being of 
all the individuals not just those you know well or who come to you or who are 
the better off and powerful. Inequalities in our society deprive many sections 
of community from health care services. These are the marginalised people and include those who come from extremely poor families, live in inaccessible or 
distant part of our villages, belong to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe families, 
have only women in their households and are disabled or handicapped. Treating everybody equally also means spending more time and effort on those 
whose needs are more.
Be responsible: Be responsible to your designated duties and never misuse 
your authority for your benefit or for the benefit of friends and relatives 
Respect people’s traditions and ideas:  People are slow to change their 
attitudes and traditions and are true to what they feel is right. Rather than 
insisting that they adopt your approach, you must try to build on their existing 
knowledge with your ideas. For example-you can promote the use of modern 
medicine together with the traditional methods and the combination may serve better than either one alone. Thus, you can promote the use of ORS for 
treating a child with diarrhoea but at the same time encourage mothers to use 
traditional preparation like rice water, coconut water to overcome dehydration.
Keep learning: Use every chance you get to increase your own knowledge 
either through reading books, or attending training programmes or asking 
questions. 
Be a role model:  If you want people to take part in improving their village and 
care for their health, you must be a role model and practise healthy habits and 
behaviours. This way you will earn people’s trust and confidence. "

 12ASHA Support and Supervision
For you to be effective and to continuously improve your skills, you  
need support and mentoring while you work in the community and  
also refresher trainings.

Committee Members
ASHA Facilitators
You all are expected to work together as a village health team "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,13,"13 Induction Training Module for ASHAsAnganwadi worker
The Anganwadi worker, like you is also a local resident. She is in charge of the 
Anganwadi Centre, which provides these services: 
l Supplementary nutrition: For children below six years, and for pregnant 
and lactating Mothers. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take-
home rations. Malnourished children are given additional food supplements. 
Adolescent girls (10 years to 19 years) are also given Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplement and tablets for de-worming.
l Growth monitoring: Involves weighing of all children below 5 years of age, but especially those who are under 3 years of age,  growth monitoring through 
growth charts, tracking malnourished children and referral for children who are 
severely malnourished. 
l Pre-school non-formal education: Includes activities for playful learning and providing a stimulating environment, with inputs for growth and 
development especially for children between three to six years of age.
Village Health and Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC)
The Village Health and Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC) is an 
institution constituted at the level of a revenue village to promote collective 
action around health, sanitation and nutrition. The VHSNC is the platform 
for taking ‘local level community action’ for monitoring health status, and to undertake local level health planning. The VHSNC includes the Panchayat 
Representatives, the AWW, the ANM, and other community members, particularly 
women, and the marginalised. In most states you are the Convenor or Member Secretary of this Committee. The VHSNC is meant to serve as a support to you 
in social mobilisation and in enabling the community to access their rights and 
entitlements. With the support of the VHSNC you can also take action on water and sanitation issues, and on social issues like early marriage, sending girls to 
school, violence against women or any other problems that are specific to  
your village. 
The VHSNC receives a sum of Rs. 10,000/- per year as an untied fund. This is to be 
used in order to undertake activities for village level improvements in sanitation 
and health status. It is your responsibility to help the PRI member and AWW to call the meeting, record the minutes, and take follow up action. 
Future training module will extensively cover your role and the functions of  
the VHSNC."

ASHA Facilitator
The first level of support for you is the 
ASHA facilitator. In most states there is 
full time woman employee for this role. 
In a few states the ANM plays the role of an ASHA facilitator. There is one facilitator 
for every 10 to 20 ASHAs. She will meet 
with you at least twice a month. One of these interactions will be in the form of 
a “mentoring” visit to the households 
where you provide services. You will also meet your facilitator in the monthly 
review meeting or a cluster meeting 
(with other ASHAs from neighbouring villages). 
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife 
The ANM provides services at the first level of the health system, which is the sub centre. But her main interaction with you is through the Village Health and 
Nutrition Day. You will learn about the sub centre later in this module. Tasks of the ASHA Facilitators 
1. Support to ASHA to promote healthy behaviours and improve service 
access among families who find it difficult to change behaviours, 
through household visits.
2. Provides on the job training to the ASHA by observing and helping her 
during counselling or care.
3. Helps ASHAs plan her work.
4. Builds up mutual solidarity and motivation among ASHA in a cluster.
5. Collects health related information on the ASHA’s work.
6. Troubleshoots problems, especially as regards payments and addressing grievances. 
7. Refills ASHA drug kit"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,16,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 16Village Health and Nutrition Day 
(VHND)
It is a common platform for people to access 
services of the ANM, Male health worker and 
of the Anganwadi Worker (AWW). It is held 
at the Anganwadi Centre (AWC) once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the 
children, provides antenatal care to pregnant 
women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. 
In addition, the ANM provides a basic 
level of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The VHND 
is an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It 
should be attended by the members of PRI, particularly the women members, 
pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. 
It is important for you to know that VHND is a major mobilisation event for your 
community and a good opportunity to reinforce health messages. As you gain experience and learn from different training programmes, you should use this 
forum to provide information on the topics in Annexure (1). These topics can 
be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. 
What should you do for a successful VHND?
After finishing this round of training, you can go back and make a list of the 
following and ensure their presence during the upcoming VHND
l Pregnant women for their antenatal care and mothers needing  postnatal care. 
l Infants who need their next dose of immunisation.
l Malnourished children.
l TB patients who are on anti-TB drugs.
l Those with fever who have not been able to see a doctor. 
l Eligible couples who need contraceptive services or counselling.
l Any others who want to meet the ANM.
Remember: As you prepare the list of people requiring services at VHND, 
make special effort to include individuals from families of new migrants, those 
living in distant hamlets, vulnerable persons because of poverty or otherwise marginalised. Coordinate with the AWW and the ANM to know in advance 
which day the VHND is scheduled so as to inform those who need these 
services and the community, especially the VHSNC members. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,17,"17 Induction Training Module for ASHAsClarifying roles and responsibilities: Given that you, the AWW, and the ANM 
work as a team, it is important that you understand not just your role, but their 
as well. The chart given in section 4 will help you understand your work with 
respect to ANM and AWW. 
Working arrangements 
As a volunteer you have a flexible work schedule. Your workload is limited to putting in about three to five hours per day on about four days per week, 
except during some mobilisation events and training programmes. Your tasks 
are to be so tailored that it does not interfere with your normal livelihood, and fits into the ‘five activities’ described on page: 8.
You will receive monetary incentive for some of the tasks you perform but there 
are many tasks which are essential for the good of the community that you would need to undertake voluntarily. For tasks where you have to be away for 
most of the day, you would be compensated. For example - training days and 
for participating in monthly meetings. 
(An illustrative list of activities for which you are paid incentives is given in 
Annexure 2. The package of services for which ASHAs are given incentive is 
state specific and varies from state to state. Thus the list provided in annexure 2 
should be replaced with state specific details.)
b. ASHA Diary

It is not possible to memorise the details of all 
individuals needing services. Keeping a systematic 
record of your work would help you in being organised and plan better. The following tools 
would proove useful in organising your work.

to treat minor ailments/problems. The content of the drug kit has been provided in Annexure 3 along 
with a Sample drug kit stock card.
The contents of the kit may change depending on 
the needs of the state. 
The drug kit is to be re-filled on a regular basis from 
the nearest PHC. To keep a record of consumption of the drugs, and for effective re-filling and ensuring

What is a Healthy Community?Section 2
Understanding your Village and your Community
You know your community well and are familiar with its health problems. If you 
list the common health or other associated problems for your village, it may 
look similar to the one depicted below:
Malnutrition
Problems related to pregnancy, lack of skilled 
care during delivery and lack of prompt care 
for complications leading to Maternal deaths
Unsafe drinking water
Improper sanitation and 
unclean surroundings
Other problems affecting the health of individuals - 
poverty, alcohol abuse, early age of marriage, etc.Common childhood illnesses like 
pneumonia, diarrhoea causing infant 
deaths & malnutrition
Infectious diseases like, malaria or 
Tuberculosis"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,20,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 20What are the Factors that Contribute to Good 
Health?
Healthy environment and hygienic habits
Our surroundings and personal hygiene have a direct impact on our 
health. Clean living environment and proper hygienic conditions ensure 
good health. The place we live, the food we eat, our drinking water and 
the air we breathe - needs to be free of pollutants, harmful chemicals and disease causing germs. This will prevent spread of many illnesses 
like respiratory infections, diarrhoea, breathing problems etc. 
Socio cultural factors
Both social and economic inequality and deprivation have an 
adverse effect on health. Thus poorer households, families from more 
marginalised communities with poor education and those in more 
health risk prone occupations are more likely to have malnutrition, illness and deaths. Social beliefs and cultural practices also have a 
strong link with the health of an individual. For example, Neglect of 
girl child leads to compromised health status of women.
Life style
Life style consists of health behaviours and practices that affect the health of individuals. Lifestyles that have a positive influence are 
regular exercise, a nutritious well balanced diet, etc. Some forms of life 
styles may be detrimental to health. These are: Alcohol/drug abuse/tobacco chewing/smoking etc. 
Genetic factors (Heredity)
Genetic make-up is what we inherit from our parents. It plays a role in determining our physical structure, appearance (body-frame, height, 
weight, looks, colour of our skin) and also some mental and emotional 
traits of our personality. It is important for you to know that some diseases are also linked to hereditary factors. They include high blood 
sugar, high blood pressure etc. 
Availability of and access to appropriate health services
For individuals to remain healthy it is important that health services 
are available, accessible and affordable. As a community health worker 
your role is not only to promote healthy life practices but also in 
facilitating and organising community’s access to health services and treatment for illnesses.There are several levels at which health services 
are provided by the health system and you will learn about this later 
in the module. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,21,"21 Induction Training Module for ASHAsAn “Activist” is person who actively leads her/his community for a 
particular cause. Before we discuss your role in detail, you should read the 
real life examples of activism in Annexure 4.
As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist primarily to reduce 
inequities and improve the access of marginalised and disadvantaged to 
public health care services. To do this you should work “along” with them and 
not “for” them, and make them understand their health needs, rights and subsequently avail services. Mobilising the community takes time and is energy 
consuming. As you mature in your work, with continuous training and support, 
you will gradually learn to mobilise your community for accessing their health rights. In the meanwhile, try not to lose patience and hope.
“In the broadest sense, a community activist is one who works for 
social change in the community.” 
Understanding Fundamental Rights
You will often find that people are not aware of their rights and face prejudices. Thus, knowledge about fundamental rights is important for every individual 
including you, the ASHA. It will help you to take appropriate decisions for the 
development of your community. 
The six Fundamental Rights granted by our Constitution are: 
The Right to Equality – This right ensures that same laws are applicable to 
every citizen. No citizen can be  discriminated against on the basis of religion, 
caste, sex, race or place of birth. He/she is entitled to have access to public 
places like shops, eating places, public health facilities, wells, tanks, bathing 
ghats, roads, playgrounds and places dedicated for the use of general public. 
Understanding Rights and 
Right to HealthSection 3
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,22,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 22Right to Freedom: The Right to Freedom enables us to speak and express 
freely, assemble peacefully without arms, form associations or unions, move 
freely throughout the territory of India, to live and settle in any part of India, 
practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
Right Against Exploitation: This right grants clear provisions to prevent 
exploitation of weaker/vulnerable sections of the community and prohibits 
“traffic i.e. selling or buying of human beings, (usually women for immoral purpose). Forced labour, bonded labour or captivity of any human being as slave 
is completely barred and employment of a child below the age of fourteen to 
work in any factory or mine or any other hazardous work is not allowed. 
Right to Freedom of Religion: This right allows every person a right to practice the religion he or she believes. 
Cultural and Educational Rights of minorities: Any citizen with a distinct language or culture has a right to practice this. No citizen can be denied 
admission to any educational institution maintained by government on the 
grounds of religion or language. All minorities have a right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice
Right to Constitutional Remedies: This right empowers citizens to approach 
the court in cases of denial of any of the Fundamental Rights. Under this 
right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints pertaining to 
violation or rights. 
Understanding the Meaning of Right to Health
Your understanding of the Right to Health will help you to be vigilant and take action to enable community’s access to avail health care services from the Public 
Health System. 
Right to Health means 
l People should have convenient access to a public healthcare facility which 
is functional and implements comprehensive health programmes with 
adequate providers, drugs and equipment.
l  Health facilities and services must be of good quality and available to 
everyone without any discrimination. Nobody should be refused treatment 
on the basis of religion, caste, economic status, gender, etc. 
l Health services should be affordable for all. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,23,"23 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Community should have information about the available services 
irrespective of their caste/class/religion/sex. They should be aware about their 
entitlements from the Public Health System. 
Y our community’s rights to health are protected if:
l Your community is able to avail free health services in the village on specific 
days through public health systems and have access to all kind of preventive 
and curative services in public health centres and hospitals with referral to 
higher facility when required.
l The community is aware about the health services and entitlements they can avail from the public health system such as free services in 
public sector hospitals, schemes of Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) or 
Janani Sishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) and any other health schemes being implemented by the government. (These two are described in the 
section on Maternal health) 
l All sections of the community including the marginalised are able to access 
the health services and avail entitlements and ANMs visit their villages 
regularly provide free services to all. 
As an ASHA, you are an important link between the community and the Health 
Facility and you also help in creating an empowered community that is aware 
about its health rights and entitlement and is able to demand it. 
Understanding NRHM
The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was launched in 2005, and its vision 
was to provide accessible, affordable and quality health care to the rural 
population particularly to the vulnerable sections. The NRHM also undertook 
the task of ensuring strengthening the health system to a guaranteed set of services within each district. The NRHM is based on a rights framework, and 
the ASHA is the first point through which people can be mobilised to realise 
their rights.
Now, we will learn about the public health facilities at various levels, services 
offered and the team of providers at each level. Annexure 5 contains a detailed 
check list, to enable you to assess the quality of health services being provided in these facilities. 
You should also try to map out the distances of each of these 
facilities from your village and identify the possible means of transportation for 
reaching these centres. This would be useful in undertaking appropriate referral 
as and when needed."

Preserving Women’s Right to Health
“The status of women in society can be used to measure the culture 
and actual development of any country”
Even today many women in our country are unable to exercise basic rights.  It 
is important to realise that unlike most men, women have to work hard both 
at home and outside. Thus women spend considerable time and effort in 
managing the house as well as helping in the income generating activity of the house-hold , so they end up with twice as much work. It is essential for you 
to understand the health status of women in our community, the common problems they face and your role in addressing some of these challenges. Women suffer many problems in various stages of their life."

"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,27,"27 Induction Training Module for ASHAsIn addition to these problems, caused by social and cultural beliefs, women are 
also more vulnerable to certain conditions/illnesses because of their physiology 
or body structure and functions. For instance, Women’s reproductive systems 
are more vulnerable, so they get more infections than men including sexually 
transmitted infections.
Women also bear the burden and pain of childbirth and abortions and are often 
solely responsible for family planning. Women have to take approval of the in-laws or the husband even for a health check- up. They often have no money to 
pay for health care on their own. Our health services and providers are also not 
fully sensitive to women’s health care needs.
Women are also generally blamed for not giving birth to baby boy, which is 
wrong. 
All females produce something called “egg” and males produce tiny 
cells called “sperms” . They fuse to form a foetus inside the women’s 
womb. Inside each egg and sperm are present chromosomes, through 
which we acquire our parent’s traits. Woman’s egg has XX chromosome and man’s sperm has XY chromosome. At the time of fusion, if the X 
chromosome from the male sperm meets the X chromosome of the 
female egg, it results in a baby girl. If the Y chromosome of the male sperm meets the X chromosome of the female it results in a baby boy. 
So, neither the man nor the woman has any control in making sure that 
a baby girl or baby boy is born.
ASHA’s role in addressing these issues
As an ASHA you are expected to help women in improving their health and social status. You should 
motivate women and convince the community to 
enhance the integrity of women in the community. To begin with, you should counsel and convince the 
community to change unfair and gender discriminatory 
practices. You could make a start by:
l Increasing participation and voice of women in all village level meetings
l Motivating women to take part in making decisions in the family. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,28,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 28l Encouraging Women to eat well and take enough rest.
l Encouraging girls to complete school education
l Ensuring that women’s’ health problems are given due importance and that 
they receive appropriate care
You could also:
l Discuss with men the need to share domestic work and child care.
l Take collective action to stop physical or mental abuse of women.
l Counsel families to raise boys and girls equally in terms of nutrition, education, and opportunities. 
l Increase awareness regarding illegality of pre-natal sex determination as well as female foeticide and infanticide.
l Raise awareness in the community about delaying age of marriage until the legal age of marriage
l Promote use of contraceptives for delay in first child birth and maintaining gap between children. 
l Increase participation of men in family planning issues.
l Provide counselling and ensure adequate care is received by women during pregnancy, child birth and post- partum period."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,29,"29 Induction Training Module for ASHAsLeadership
Leadership as an ASHA involves mobilising people and resources towards 
achieving the common goal of health care. Through knowledge and experience 
most people have the potential to become a leader in any given situation. As 
an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in 
being an effective leader
Leadership means to be
l	Responsible 
l	Setting an example so other people follow you. 
l		Inspiring - provide optimism and confidence in people for their 
ability to carve change.
l		Non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions 
l		Confident, assertive, enthusiastic, passionate and accountable 
l		Skilled in enabling people to cooperate for getting things done.
Leadership style 
People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are  
a) Authoritarian and b) Participatory
Authoritarian leaders do not welcome cooperation or collaboration from others. 
They expect people to do what they are told without question or debate. They are usually intolerant of what they do not agree with. It is difficult for team members 
to contribute their views or empower themselves under this kind of leadership. 
A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members 
can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to effectively 
reach the set goals and simultaneously strengthen the bonds among various 
members. This leads to a more productive team. As an ASHA, it is most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. 
Skills of an ASHASection 4"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,30,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 30For participatory leadership you need to
l Establish goals and set the direction: First articulate an achievable goal for 
your village. Involve your community through local institutions especially the 
village health sanitation and nutrition committee on how, where and when 
it would be completed. For example, all children of your village should be immunised in the next six months. 
l Set high standards and high expectations: Be firm 
about ensuring high quality health care services from 
the sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. 
Eg. Make sure that the ANM reaches the village on the designated VHND, with the requisite equipment 
and drugs (weighing scales, BP apparatus, disposable 
syringes for immunisation, ice box for vaccines) and drugs and provides the package of services for 
mothers and children. If the health service provider treats a community member with disrespect or does not provide the services or does not pay 
attention to quality, you should feel able to ask her to change behaviour or 
practice.
l Be accountable and responsible: to the community and the health care provider by being an effective link and sharing information. But being 
constantly critical of the situation will have no positive outcome. Address the 
issue by sharing your grievances with authorities who can take action. For example, if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting 
the houses of socially backward families, have the courage to tell her that you 
have noted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. Enlist the help of VHSNC, Sarpanch, Block Medical Health Officer or Chief 
Medical Health Officer and ensure that the ANM visits your village regularly.
l Involve others in decision-making: Do not make any decisions alone. A 
decision, which affects the community, needs to be taken along with the community members, with their complete ownership. For example, better 
results are attained if priorities and decisions regarding community health needs are taken as part of collectives such as the VHSNC. 
l Motivate others: By involving the Panchayat, SHG members and VHSNC 
through regular contact, sharing necessary information, giving them 
responsibility and acknowledging their support and efforts in public. 
Invite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care. Involve community members in the process when availing for them 
their entitlements from the public health system or by giving them some 
responsibility to improve the health status of the community. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,31,"31 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Achieve unity: As a leader you need to promote unity among your 
community members and between the community members and health 
care providers. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership 
for their health and see that they also have a role in achieving the goal.
l Serve as a role models: Always set an example that can be followed. For 
example, you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman 
for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the life of woman in your 
village, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman 
during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if 
required. You should constantly improve your knowledge and skills and try to 
be aware of any new developments regarding the health services and new 
schemes declared primarily by being in touch with the ANM. Improve your 
skills by practising them.
l Represent the community: Make sure you represent the entire community 
(including the marginalised sections) while discussing their health concerns 
with the health service provider. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and VHSNC. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of 
the poor of your community. If some segment of the community has shared 
that the source of drinking water is not accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion while developing a comprehensive health plan for the 
village. 
Communication Skills
Communication is the exchange or 
two-way flow of information and ideas 
between two or more persons. People 
who do not communicate well, create confusion, frustration and problems. Your 
communication skills will enable you to 
counsel women and families on health promotion, adopting healthier practices 
and mobilising them to avail services at health institutions. They also help you 
establish rapport with the stakeholders and other health functionaries.There are three different forms of communication - verbal; non-verbal and written. 
Each of these is useful for you. 
l Verbal communication: This is the most common way of communicating, 
but should be done in a way that the person or persons to whom you are 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,32,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 32communicating the message has understood it. So you must deliver it in 
a way that the person understands what you are saying. To know if your 
message was received properly, get feedback from the person whether she/
he understood the message. One-way communication is when only you talk 
and the other has not understood. This is incomplete and ineffective.
Effective Verbal Communication has Accuracy;  
Clarity and Correctness. 
l Non-Verbal Communication: We all know that communication is not only 
about words and languages. Silence also communicates, and there are 
gestures that people make with their hands, body and eyes. These forms 
of communication are referred to as non-verbal communication. Here are some non-verbal forms of communication:
l Eye contact: with the person to whom you are talking will indicate your sincerity and confidence. 
l Body posture: Facing the person, standing or sitting appropriately close and holding your head erect gives value or weight to your messages
l Facial expressions: Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions therefore express appropriate feelings on your face
l Gestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. 
l Written Communication: As an ASHA you will need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You 
also need to document the processes and decisions taken during meetings. 
You will thus have to learn to write simply and effectively. (In Annexure 6, 
there is an exercise for you on writing). Even if you take the help of others in 
the community, you should remember the following important points: 
l Address it to the appropriate person 
l Check that the letter has a date and topic 
l Keep sentences short and avoid unnecessary words
l Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones 
l Explain facts through evidence and examples 
Active listening is also part of communication
Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening 
involves the reception and interpretation of what is heard. Active listening 
involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,33,"33 Induction Training Module for ASHAsdirections, understand others, solve problems, share interests, and see how the 
other person feels, or even show support. This type of listening takes the same 
amount of, or more, energy than speaking. It requires the listener to hear various 
messages, understand the meaning and then verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. 
For good listening: Encourage individuals to talk by using positive gestures 
and words, remove distractions and try to understand non-verbal signals. Do not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking. Reflect 
on the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard. This will enable 
establishing a good rapport with the community.
Communicating with stakeholders- Keep in mind the following points 
while talking to stakeholders and health functionaries- 
l Give due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. 
l While sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence.
l Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you 
want to continue.
l Be calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety and do not 
use a blaming tone.
You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those 
around you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your 
message through.
Points to take care of while communicating:
l When you visit families, greet the individuals and explain the reason of your 
visit.
l Maintain eye contact with the person to whom you are talking, act with confidence but speak in a gentle tone which is loud enough to be heard and 
always be respectful
l Stick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time and use 
simple words in local language. Do not use technical words or jargon. Your 
pronunciation should be clear.
l Be specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating. 
l Be empathetic and try to share the feelings of individuals."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,34,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 34l Be open-minded. This will help you understand the other person’s point of 
view. In case of talking to your beneficiary check if she has any question and 
answer in simple language
l Acknowledge the efforts made by the beneficiaries and never forget to 
compliment/appreciate them.
Note: In health communication, while counselling individuals you need to actively listen to what is being said, analyse all the factors and then dialogue with the person so that, together, the right choices are made. Counselling involves problem 
solving and not merely preaching to adopt correct practices. 
Decision Making Skills
Each decision has a consequence and even a small 
decision can change many things. All of us can recall 
some such decisions taken personally or by others 
which have left an important impact. As an ASHA you will be often required to take decisions, that will affect 
the community at large. Hence, you should learn the 
skill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. 
Some basic steps of decision-making are: 
l Define the Problem: Examine the situation carefully 
and analyse it from all perspectives to find out the 
actual problem. 
l Gather Information and share with the community: As a next step collect 
all the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Take information on what exists, what does not 
exists and what needs to be there. At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meeting and discuss the situation to help them 
become part of the solution. 
l Think of possible solutions: You should work with the VHSNC and even the 
Gram Sabha if needed on identifying solutions. At this stage many solutions will be offered. It shows that people accept and understand the problem, and 
are interested in identifying solutions.
l Choose one solution by consensus: Part of effective decision-making is 
the ability to select one alternative from the various options available. This 
can be done through consensus of the community and approval of the 
authorities. To gain consensus and approval you need to discuss this in the VHSNC meetings and the Gram Sabha. Before selecting the right alternative, 
assess all available options. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,35,"35 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Put the Decisions to Work: An effective decision is one which can be put 
into action. Thus, implementation is very important. During this process, 
keep checking if it is moving towards the expected solution, and if there is 
something else which needs to be addressed. An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling 
among group members after the meeting 
has been a djourned. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature 
among persons or groups.
Decision-making skills are sharpened through experience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. 
How to handle difficult situations
If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and 
review the options. It may be a good idea to adjourn and let people think about 
it overnight. 
Negotiation Skills
Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. As 
an ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these 
differences to achieve the larger goals of village health programmes. You will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to 
fulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to 
negotiate with people in authority but with enough preparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situation which requires negotiation. 
The steps of Successful Negotiation
l Ask for the other person’s perspective: In a negotiating situation use 
questions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. 
Some examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? 
What are your concerns about what I am suggesting/asking? When you hear 
the other person express their needs or concerns, use appropriate listening 
responses to make sure you heard correctly. 
l State Y our needs: In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but 
also why you need it. 
l Prepare options beforehand: Before entering into a negotiation, prepare 
some options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not 
acceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and 
be prepared to counter the same with an alternative. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,36,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 36l Do not argue: Negotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about 
trying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation 
when each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. 
If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a power struggle. 
l Consider timing: There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on 
either side, a preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or 
tiredness on one side or the other. 
Suggestions for effective negotiation 
While negotiating as an ASHA you must be patient. Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to 
understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not 
begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. 
Approach a negotiation with an attitude of,  “I accept you as an equal 
negotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ 
You may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. 
How to use your negotiation skills effectively?
In your community you may come across several issues that require to be 
addressed. For example, VHND does not take place, the Anganwadi is not 
functioning well; children and women are not receiving their entitlement of 
supplementary food; the midday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly; widow pension is not being received despite completion of 
formalities etc. 
l To change such situations first try to find out if things can be changed 
by drawing the attention of people like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the 
schoolteacher, AWW through direct dialogue.
l If the situation still does not improve, try to organise people and facilitate 
group discussions over the issue. The VHSNC meeting is a good forum to 
address such issues.
l If this also does not work, try to identify organisations working on the same 
issue and seek their support. If you decide to initiate a movement alongwith 
the people to change a situation, organising people who are affected with the 
same issues is important and is essential for activism to be effective. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,37,"37 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Activism/Protest may not always be the best method of changing the 
situation but it can be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives 
voice to a cause.
Coordination Skills
As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community and 
expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders and the community. 
The coordination with the ASHA and AWW has already been discussed. 
l Obtaining and updating information on decisions taken at the PHC or at the 
Integrated Child Development officer’s level on schemes and programmes 
related to health service provision 
l Sharing concerns regarding the access to health care and nutrition services 
at the village level 
l Planning health activities to get optimum outcome like- a health camp at the village level or organise VHND

Knowing About Health, 
Hygiene and IllnessSection 5
You have been introduced to various determinants of health. This 
section will help you understand in detail the role of food and hygiene in 
maintaining good health.
Role of Diet and Food in Maintaining Good Health
We all know that we need food to give us energy, live and grow. Our 
regular requirement of food depends on the stage of our life and the 
amount of work we do. To grow better we need sufficient amounts of 
food rich in all essential elements. 
A newborn needs only mother’s milk till six months of age and needs 
it frequently. After six months the child needs complementary feeding 
and can gradually learn to eat all that adults eat, though it should be given in smaller amounts and more frequently. 
Food requirements of a pregnant mother are higher than other women.
The important qualities of our food are related to the nutrition it 
provides, its quantity and frequency.
What constitutes good food? 
Major constituents of the balanced diet and their functions are:
l Proteins: Important for body growth and strength. Milk, Pulses and beans are plant sources and animal sources include eggs, poultry 
products, all kinds of meat products and fish.
l Carbohydrates*: Form the bulk of our food and the main source 
of our daily energy needs. This we get mainly from cereals like, rice, 
wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra. Tubers like potato also provide 
carbohydrates.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,42,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 42l Fat (from oils and ghee) – Provide extra energy, 
and are good especially for children, as they give 
more energy as compared to cereals. Fat cells 
stored in our body also act as an insulation to protect it from heat and cold. They also help in 
absorption of certain Vitamins like A and D. Fats 
are derived from sources like oil, butter, ghee,  nuts etc.
l Vitamins and Minerals – They are essential nutrients required in small quantities and help 
fight diseases. Present in vegetables, fruits, 
sprouts. Calcium, iron, iodine and zinc are some key minerals required by body. 
l Fibres or roughage and plenty of water –  Are also essential for a healthy body 
* (Traditionally communities used to eat more coarse cereals like sorghum (called Jowaar), maize, ragi, and bajra. Wheat and Rice became popular in our country 
only in recent decades. The traditional cereals are richer 
in nutritional value and were more easily available to all sections of society as they were grown easily and were 
cheap. All cereals when eaten in less polished form, retain 
more nutritional value.)
Good Dietary Practices –These include eating a 
balanced diet which is full of all essential components 
of food in right proportions. Frequency of meals is also an important aspect. Children and Pregnant 
Women should have more meals. Having a balanced 
mix of different food items like cereals, pulses, green vegetables and fruits is good for our health. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,43,"43 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Role of Personal Hygiene and Clean Surroundings in 
keeping Good Health
Personal Hygiene and cleanliness are not only essential to a good quality of life, 
they are also closely related to maintaining good health and preventing disease. 
“Gandhi Ji said that Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” 
Many infections spread either through unhygienic surroundings or poor 
personal hygiene.
Faeces
Flies
Food
MouthWater Hands
The illustration above shows the many ways in which the disease causing 
organisms spread from human faeces into the food we eat and the water 
we drink. To save ourselves from diseases we have to check these routes of 
infection with changes in our day to day hygienic practices.
Common measures adopted to ensure good health
A) Personal measures
i) Hand washing
l The simple practice of hand washing can stop the spread of diseases very 
effectively. 
l Hands should be washed regularly at all times with soap, especially after defecation and before preparing, serving and eating food. 
l Soil should not be used to wash hands, because it is often contaminated with harmful micro-organisms. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,44,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 44l Hand washing can be done with ash, but for this ash must be fresh from the 
fire. Because it is difficult to ensure that the ash we are using is fresh and 
uncontaminated, its use must be discouraged.
l For hand washing to be effective it must be done properly and all 6 steps of 
hand washing must be followed every time. Refer Annexure 8 for details.
l Hand washing will not be effective, as long as our nails are not cut. Spaces between the nails and fingers collect dirt. 
The two practices of using clean toilets and hand washing, together can stop the spread of many communicable diseases to a large extent.
ii) Maintaing hygiene of other body parts
l Skin: Cleanliness of skin is essential for overall body hygiene and is particularly important in a hot country like ours. A daily bath with soap and 
water and thorough cleaning of hands, feet and face helps in removing 
sweat and accumulated dirt. Dirt makes the body a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. Wearing clean, dry clothes and footwear help us remain 
clean and keep away many skin infections. A daily change of clothes, 
particularly undergarments, is a good practice. 
l Teeth and gums-Teeth should be brushed regularly at least twice every day, using a soft bristled brush. Brushing removes food particles accumulated 
between our teeth and prevents the growth of bacteria which cause cavities 
and gum disease. 
l Hair: Keeping hair clean by regular wash with a mild shampoo/soap is important to avoid infections and infestation by head lice.
B) Measures pertaining to our surrounding
i) Using clean toilets
The practice of open defecation is common in our rural areas as well as in many 
of the urban pockets. Due to this, harmful organisms contaminate the soil and 
water sources. Use of sanitary toilets by all will stop this faecal contamination. As an ASHA you should work with the VHSNC in ensuring that all households have 
access to sanitary toilets and use them regularly. There are many government 
schemes that provide support for construction of toilets. 
ii) Safe handling of food and water
Safe handling of food and water also prevents many diseases. This can be achieved 
through:  
l Cleaning of the food items before cooking or consuming.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,45,"45 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l Keeping the food covered, away from dirt and flies.
l Avoiding consumption of partially cooked meat, eggs and unboiled milk.
l Using clean utensils for storing, cooking and consuming food. 
l Drinking water from clean water source.
l Storing water in clean, covered pots.
l Using a long handle ladle or a utensil with a tap to take out water to prevent 
contamination. Benefits of clean water source like hand pumps are often 
lost when the water is not handled properly.
iii) Sanitary disposal of solid and liquid waste 
Accumulated solid and liquid waste is a breeding ground for many disease causing organisms. This should be checked through:
l Preventing collection of solid waste in the surroundings- Decaying 
solid waste is a breeding ground for many vectors like housefly, rats, kala-
azar etc. Support of VHSNC should be taken for arranging regular disposal 
of solid waste. You should facilitate community sensitisation against poor environmental hygienic practices. Waste disposal measure such as 
‘composting' can also be encouraged.
l Preventing pooling of wastewater in our villages- It is a health hazard as 
it acts as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other harmful organisms. It 
also creates problems in movement of people and is dangerous particularly 
for children .
l Stopping water logging around water sources like hand pump or wells- The waste water from houses also adds to water logging if there are no 
provisions for proper drainage.
l Making kitchen gardens and Soak-pits around sources of waste water- 
These are easy methods for disposal of wastewater. Kitchen gardens for 
growing vegetables and fruits help in absorbing extra water. In villages 
finding small places around every house for kitchen gardens may not be difficult. Soak-pits are a good way to stop pools of water, particularly in 
streets and common pathways. They absorb water without forming a pool. 
(Annexure-9 shows you how make a soak-pit)
l Creating drainage systems- Apart from these measures, the village may still need a proper drainage system. These can be both open and covered 
type. Open drains require much more regular cleaning to avoid chocking 
of water flow. "

 46What is Illness/Disease/Sickness
Disease is an abnormal condition affecting the body. Disease is often used 
to refer to any condition that causes pain,  dysfunction,  distress,  or death to 
the person afflicted. It usually affects people not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically, as diseases can alter one’s perspective on life and their personality.
Diseases can also be classified as communicable and non-communicable 
disease.
Communicable diseases – These are diseases that spread from one person to 
another either directly or through a carrier such as a mosquito or flies. Some 
examples of such diseases are: Common colds, (directly) Diarrhoeal diseases (flies), Malaria (mosquitoes), and Tuberculosis (directly). Steps must be taken 
to prevent their spread from the persons affected to other people in the 
community.
Non Communicable diseases – They are usually associated with people’s life 
styles (tobacco, alcohol, obesity), pollution, and deficiency or excess of some 
nutrients. They never spread from one person to another. Some common examples are high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and many other 
illnesses. 
In our community we may notice some people living with various physical and 
mental disabilities such as deafness, blindness etc. Physical and mental injuries 
due to accidents such as road accident/accidents which occur at work and 
animal bites also belong to this category. 
Healing 
Our body has its own defence, or way to resist diseases and heal itself. In most 
cases, these natural defence mechanisms are more important to our health than medicines. 
Have you seen how a tree heals its axe injury? First the gum fills the gap. The gum 
hardens and gradually becomes wooden. A similar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. 
Even in a case of more serious illness, when a medicine is needed, it is the body 
that must overcome the disease; the medicine only helps. Cleanliness, rest, adequate nutritious food and water are essential to help the patient recover 
from the disease and live a healthy life. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,47,"47 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Our body has its own defence mechanism (immunity) which fights against 
germs or diseases causing organisms. This system matures as body learns how 
to fight germs. This helps us recover from an illness. The severity and duration of 
illness vary with the type of the pathogen and defence mechanism of the body to resist the infection.
Note – Components of mother’s breast milk enable baby to fight many illnesses. 
The first thick milk (colostrum) is a priceless shield for the baby and should never be discarded. 
In case of non- communicable diseases adopting an active and healthy life 
style is the key to prevent, reverse or minimise the symptoms of the diseases. Medications and supplements may also provide help in reducing the effects of 
such diseases. In some severe conditions surgeries may be required. 
Treatment for Diseases
Healing with traditional medicines
There are certain traditional ways of healing and treating illnesses. 
The traditional systems of medicines include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, 
Siddha and Homeopathy. There are also home remedies which are 
passed on through generations. Many of these are of great value, cheaper and do not have harmful side effects as only natural herbs 
and therapies are used in making them. Some common herbs 
and home remedies have been mentioned in Annexure- 10. Some diseases are helped by traditional medicines, while others can be 
treated better with modern medicines.
Treatment with modern medicines
For first contact care we need very few medicines. As an ASHA 
you will learn to use some medicines/drugs. For example: 
Paracetomol, Chloroquine, Iron Folic acid and ORS.
The use of each drug; its dose, how many times to be given, 
side effects, and precautions are given in Annexure11. Read this carefully before 
using the drugs. These medicines are safe, cheap and very effective. We will 
learn about some more medicines in the subsequent trainings.
Modern medicines have side effects. Thus it is important to use them rationally 
and prevent injudicious usage.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,48,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 48ASHAs Role in Promoting Rational Drug Use
Spread awareness in the community on 
Avoiding overuse of injections and saline (bottle)
Try to overcome the prevalent belief that injections and saline are always necessary. Some 
patients insist on injections and saline bottles. Many doctors are also driven by profit 
motives. You should educate people that these are useful only in certain conditions. People can save expenses with help of simple remedies. The saline in the bottle is just water, salt 
and some sugar. If we prepare it at home and take orally the effect is the same.
Preventing misuse of TonicsMany doctors prescribe these tonics, because patients ask for them. Tonics are not 
necessary for the growth of body or to give energy. They are just a combination of 
water, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In most of the cases, for gaining strength and ensuring growth a simple nutritious home cooked meal 
is enough.
Avoiding self-medicationPeople often buy medicines by themselves or use any medicines lying in the house for 
conditions such as fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headaches. This should not be 
done. Most drugs cause side effects, and some are harmful. The side effects of some of the commonly used medicines used in self-medication are:
l Drugs used as pain killers: Almost all painkillers cause irritation of stomach and many of these, when taken over long periods, can cause internal bleeding and 
stomach ulcers.
l Anti-allergic drugs: Are used in the treatment of cold and cough and can cause 
sleepiness, which can sometimes cause accidents.
l Antibiotics: Antibiotics might cause life-threatening ‘reactions’ if a person is allergic to them. Some antibiotics can disturb intestinal bacteria and induce diarrhoea.
Many drugs affect our vital organs, like the liver and the kidney as these organs flush out drugs and toxins from our body. Some people also treat children with the same medications which have been prescribed to adults. This is dangerous since children 
need much smaller doses. Doses are given according to the body weight. Most 
importantly, pregnant women should not take any medicine without consulting a qualified doctor, as these could harm the unborn baby. 
Taking correct dose of medicines
Both overdose and inadequate dosage can be harmful, especially in children. People 
should strictly adhere to dosage and schedule of drugs as recommended by the doctor. 
Education about rational drug use in community will help you in your work. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,49,"49 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Fever
Fever is a common symptom of many diseases and not an illness on its 
own. Some mild fevers subside without any treatment or treatment at 
home. Such fevers are not accompanied by cough, ear discharge, rash 
diarrhoea or any other sign of obvious infection in any organ. However, in many cases it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness.
For healthy individuals of 18-40 years of age, the mean normal oral 
temperature is just above 36.8°C (plus or minus 0.4 degree celsius) or 98.2 °F (plus or minus 0.7). After an attack by germs, our body reacts by generating 
more heat and hence causing fever. But excess fever may be harmful and may 
lead to distress and several complications. 
Thermometer is used for measuring temperature and i t is wise to take a sick 
person’s temperature before deciding on further action.
Managing fever
l Fever associated with self- limited infections and lasting for one or two days duration: Needs no specific treatment. It is managed through taking 
r
est, drinking plenty of fluids like water, rice water, soup, buttermilk etc. and 
light meals. One should avoid taking oily or spicy food. 
 If patient is uncomfortable or has body ache or headache  you can provide 
Paracetamol* tablet for controlling fever and relieving symptoms. One 
tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days 
and refer if the fever persists (See Annexure 11 for details)
l Persisting fever or fever with chills, rashes, drowsiness, stiff neck etc. This is associated with serious infections and n
eeds immediate referral to a 
hospital. 
(*Paracetamol tablet or syrup is a general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not eliminate the causative factors  
 from body.)
Dealing with Common Health 
ProblemsSection 6
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,50,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 50In case of newborns or small infants, any fever should be taken seriously. A baby 
has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit( 37.2 degree celsius). 
If you are approached for the baby having fever; you should give the first dose 
of paracetamol and immediately refer to a hospital. See Annexure 11 for specific dosage and schedule.
Note: Fever a
bove 39.5°C (103°F) is high fever. Refer immediately any person 
with high fever after sponging and giving tablet Paracetamol.
For high fever in a child sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use cold 
water as it causes shivers. Do not cover with a blanket. Keep windows open and give 
enough water and fluids to drink.
Remember
Several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g. Malaria, Pneumonia, 
Pus (anywhere) Typhoid, TB, Kala-Azar, Filariasis, Brain Fever, HIV/AIDS etc.  
We will learn about them later. Even when we think it to be a mild fever and there is no sign of infection in any organ or loss of conciousnesess, do not wait  for more than 2 days and refer.  If any danger signs are seen refer at once to an 
ANM or a PHC.
Pain
Aches and Pain are one of the most common complaints and are sometimes 
associated with fever and other illnesses.
What is pain?
Pain is a signal that something is wrong inside our body. It is an unpleasant sensation which is associated with tissue damage.
The role of the ASHA in pain relief
Pain is only a symptom of illness, we need to find out the illness and treat it as soon as possible. 
In mild forms of pain where there is no injury or other symptoms like swelling,  
fever and body pains like headache, backache etc. you can give Paracetamol 
Tablet from your Drug Kit (Refer – Annexure 11 for dosage) and advise 
rest. 
Ayurveda suggests gentle oil message for body aches and back aches. 
If the pain does not subside in a day or two or gets worse, you can refer to the PHC. 
Immediate referral to a hospital is needed in the following cases:
l Any pain with convulsion, any severe chest or abdomen pain 
l Headache with neck stiffness 
l Any pain associated with burn injury and in joints. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,51,"51 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Common Cold and Cough
l It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans.
l No specific treatment exists but one can relieve the symptoms
l Common home remedies can be used for relieving the symptoms like 
honey, ginger, tulsi tea. For details refer Annexure-10
l Giving lukewarm water to drink and maintaining proper nutrition is helpful.
l If the symptoms are severe, and if there is body-ache, or headache, tablet Paracetamol can be given. Refer annexure-11 for details.
First Aid for Injuries and Wounds*
Wound care
You may come across situations, where you will have to manage common wounds and injuries. This section would help you understand the management 
of different types of wounds.
Types of woundWounds are of three categories:
1. Wounds without bleeding 
2. Wounds with bleeding 
3. Infected Wound
1. Care of the wounds with no bleeding
These wounds include small abrasions, small cuts, scrapes and other small 
wounds.  Prompt first aid can help nature heal small wounds and deal with 
germs. Bleeding is usually limited to oozing and is due to damage to minute 
blood vessels. Even these types of wounds need to be attended immediately as they may get contaminated and become infected.
Take the following steps while managing these wounds:
l Wash your hands using soap and water
l Clean the wound, using pre boiled and cold water (Soap can be used if the 
wound is contaminated with dirt. But remember excess soap may damage 
the flesh.) 
 Or, gently w ipe the dirt away using cotton without rubbing it. Rubbing 
disturbs the clot and restart bleeding, thus delaying the healing process. Use 
different cotton swabs each time.
* Certain parts of this section have been taken from the book Where There is no Doctor."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,52,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 52l Place a piece of clean gauze or cloth over the wound. Cloth should be light 
enough to allow passage of air for quick healing. 
l Advise the person to change the gauze or cloth every day.
Remember
Any bit of dirt that is left in a wound can cause an infection. A clean wound 
will heal without any medicine. Cleanliness is of first importance in preventing 
infection and helping wounds to heal. If a person gets a cut, scrape or wound,  
he/she should be referred immediately to take Tetanus Toxoid injection.
Family members should be warned to:
l Avoid using animal or human faeces or mud on a wound. These can 
cause dangerous infections, such as tetanus.      
l Never put alcohol, tincture of iodine, or any medicine directly into a wound; doing so will damage the flesh and make healing slower.
l Avoid disturbing the scab (a dry covering over the wound) that has been formed.
l Visit a health facility if there is a deep/sharp cut for which stitches may be needed. 
 Refer persons to nearby health facility immediately in case the cut is large.
2. Care of the wound with bleeding: 
Minor bleeding is readily controlled by pressure and elevation. In such cases 
a small ashesive dressing is all that is necessary.  Medical aid need only be 
sought if the bleeding does not stop or if the wound is 
at special risk of infection. 
Steps to control severe external bleeding from wound: 
l Raise the injured part
l Apply pressure on the wound directly by using  
your fingers or palm preferably over a clean sterile 
cloth/bandage. 
l Hold the pressure. Don't keep checking to see if the 
bleeding has stopped because this may damage or dislodge the clot that's forming and cause 
bleeding to resume.
l If the bleeding is severe take patient to the hospital 
immediately and keep the pressure on. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,53,"53 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l If the bleeding can not be controlled by pressing on the wound, or the 
presure point, and if the person is losing a lot of blood you can tie the limb 
as close to the wound as possible, keeping the wounded part raised.
 Do not make the tie so tight that the affected area becomes blue. For 
the tie, use a folded cloth or a wide belt; never use thin rope, string, or wire.
3. Care of the infected wounds
Any wound which is red, swollen, hot, and painful with pus, or a foul smell is an 
infected wound. 
A deep bullet or knife wound runs a high risk of dangerous infection. You can 
know that the infection is spreading to other parts of the body if there is fever and a red line above the wound.
Wounds which may become dangerously infected are:
l Wounds with debris or made with dirty objects
l Puncture wounds and other deep wounds that do not bleed
l Wounds made where animals are kept: in cowsheds, pigpens, etc
l Large wounds with severe laceration or bruising
l Wounds due to bites, especially from dogs or other animals
l Bullet wound or knife wound 
Management of infected wounds
Infected wounds are serious and need immediate medical 
attention. Quick referral to a health facility for treatment with 
an antibiotic and injection for Tetanus Toxoid is needed. Leave 
the wound open and avoid covering the wound with bandages. Fresh air enables these wounds to heal faster.
Animal Bites
Dog bite and other animal bites
Dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness, which is called rabies. Rabies comes from the bite of a 
rabid or ‘mad’ animal, usually a rabid dog, cat, bats, fox, wolf, 
or jackal. This illness, affects the brain and nervous system. No cure is available for rabies. Anti- Rabies Vaccine (ARV) immediately 
after the dog bite can prevent this fatal illness. These vaccines are 
available in government hospitals. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,54,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 54Signs of Rabies
In the animal
l Acts strangely –sometimes sad, restless and irritable
l Foaming at the mouth, cannot eat or drink
l Sometimes the animal goes wild (mad) and may bite anyone or anything 
nearby. The animal may also become sleepy.
l The animal dies within 10 days
In People
l Pain and tingling in the area of the bite
l Irregular breathing, as if the person has just been crying.
l Initially, the person is afraid to drink water. Later he becomes afraid of water.
l Pain and difficulty in swallowing. A lot of thick, sticky saliva.
l The person is alert, but very nervous or excitable. Fits of anger between periods of calm.
l As death nears, fits (convulsions) and paralysis.
Note
l A bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. Even a scratch on the skin or a lick on the open wound may give rabies infection. 
l Rabies infection is likely if the dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows or develops any signs of rabies.
l First symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear, within 10 days or more after the bite. 
l Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. 
l The effect of Anti Rabies Vaccine reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. 
Role of an ASHA
In case you are approached, provide immediate wound care and take the following steps:
l Wash the wound well with soap and water 
l Leave the wound open or tie a loose dressing
l Refer to a health facility where an anti-rabies vaccine is available and doctor present will decide whether this vaccine is to be given. Advice to take TT 
injections in case not vaccinated for tetanus before.
l If the bite is in the head, neck, shoulders and chest, bring the person 
immediately to the health centre for anti-rabies injection. Don’t wait for  
15 days."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,55,"55 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l Suggest the family to keep the dog under watch by keeping it tied for 15 
days. If the dog dies within this period or develops abnormal behaviour, 
there is an increased risk in the individual to develop serious infection.
You should build awareness in the community regarding
l Vaccination of the dogs and other animals against rabies, as per the schedule. 
Usually rabies vaccine is effective for a period of six months or an year. 
l To keep children and family members away from any animal that seems sick or acts strangely.
l To avoid contacts with saliva, urine, or perspiration of the bitten person as these secretions are infectious.
l Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Inform the appropriate authority if you suspect a sick or a rabid dog.
Spread awareness to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals. It is the 
saliva of the animal that contains germs if infected by rabies
Snake bite
All snakes are not poisonous, nor can they outrun man as commonly believed. Snakebites are common in rainy seasons and night hours. There are only four 
common poisonous snakes in India. These are Common Cobra (Hindi : Nag); 
Common Krait (Hindi : Bangarus); Russel’s Viper (Hindi : Daboia); Saw-scaled Viper (Hindi : Phoorsa) 
Identification of poisonous and non-poisonous snake bite
l Poisonous Snake :The bite of a poisonous snake leaves marks of 
the two fangs ( and at rare times, other little marks made by the teeth).
l Non – Poisonous Snake : The bite of a snake that is not poisonous leaves only 2 rows of teeth marks, but no fang marks. This Identification is most 
reliable if we know the species of the snake.
Sign of poisonous snake bite
l Pain at the site of bite. There may also be pain in abdomen and sometimes 
diarrhoea
l There may be local swelling.
l Blister formation around the site and spreading blister suggest a large dose of venom. 
l Local tissue necrosis with an offensive, rotten smell
l Weakness of the muscle around the eyes (drooping of eyelids) . The person may start seeing double (double vision) and may develop a squint. He may 
not be able to swallow anything.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,56,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 56l Cough, difficulty in breathing leading to death. (Cough indicates severe 
poisoning and may not appear until 10 hours after the bite)
l  Abnormal bleeding 
l There may be vomiting and collapse
l Shock and haemorrhage may occur up to a week after the bite if anti venom is not given.
First aid in any snake bite 
The effective and quick first aid can save most patients. No magic or temple 
prayers can undo the poison bites.
l Make the person lie down and relax. Do not make the patient walk.
l In case of non-poisonous snake bite, it is sufficient to clean and disinfect the wound. 
Poisonous Snakebite is dangerous – refer to the health centre immediately after following first aid:
l Keep the bitten area still, do not allow it to move.
l Wrap the bitten area with wide elastic bandage or clean cloth to slow the spread of poison.
l Put on a splint to prevent the limb from moving. 
l Carry the person, on a stretcher or a bed to the nearest health centre.
l If the snake has been killed, you can take along the snake, because different snakes require different treatment (anti-venom). If an anti-venom is needed, 
leave the bandage on until the injection is given. Bandage should be 
removed in hospital only after the doctor advice.
You should know about the hospitals in your area, where anti snake venom drugs and doctors are 
available to undertake the treatment. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,57,"57 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Burns
Burns are common injuries in India and women and children generally are 
the common victims. This is often due to the handling of gas or the pressure 
stove while cooking. Children may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids 
— like milk, oil, dal, tea etc. 
Common causes of burns 
l Kitchen accidents - commonly bursting of pressure stoves 
l Fire crackers 
l Explosion in work places 
l House fires 
l Chemical burns 
l Electric burns 
l Suicide attempts 
l Murder attempts 
Types of burns and care
l Minor Burns: Pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, apply gentian 
violet and use Tablet Paracetamol for pain relief. (Annexure 11 for dosage). 
If it gets infected or the healing is slow then refer.
l Deep Burns: These destroy the skin, expose raw flesh and cover large areas 
of body. Apply gentian violet, wrap the burnt part with clean cloth or towel 
and immediately refer to a health facility. 
 If you do not have Gentian violet, then cover it loosely with a cotton cloth or 
sheet and immediately refer.
l For Burns of joints or skin folds: i.e. between the fingers, in the armpit, or at other joints, insert gauze pads with Vaseline between the burned surface 
to prevent this from sticking together as they heal. 
Also, fingers, arms, and 
legs should be straightened completely several times a day while healing. This is painful but helps prevent scars that limit movement.
Inform the individual about the following burn care:
l Keep the burn as clean as possible and protect it from dirt, dust and flies. 
These can  lead to infections in burns. Signs of an infection in a burn include 
- pus, bad smell and fever. Infected burns need special care with antibiotics. 
Refer the patient to the ANM or the nearest PHC.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,58,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 58l Never put grease, fat, hides, coffee, herbs, or faeces on a burn
l Any person who has been badly burned can easily go into shock because of 
pain, fear, and the loss of body fluids due to oozing from burn.
l  Badly burned person should eat foods rich in protein and drink plenty of liquid during the recovery period. In case of acute burns it is suggested that 
the burned person should try to drink four litres of fluid in a day for a large 
burn, and 12 litres a day for a very large burn.
 Spread awareness in the community to adopt following safety measures
l Don’t let small babies go near a fire 
l Keep lamps and matches out of reach of children
l Stoves and hot pans should be placed in a way that children cannot reach them
l Synthetic clothes catch fire quite quickly. They stick to the skin more easily. Advise people to always take care regarding their clothes and sari 
‘pallus’ etc. during cooking. 
l Over-pumping the stove before pinning and igniting is dangerous. ‘First 
pin and then pump’ is the correct method to light the stove.
l Sometimes burn injuries are intentionally inflicted (most often, on women). In such cases if you are aware of NGOs or counsellors that help such women, 
you should let the woman know. If necessary, the doctors will initiate legal 
measures in these cases."

Infectious Diseases - Tuberculosis 
(TB, Leprosy and Malaria)Section 7
In this session you will learn about three infectious diseases - TB, Malaria and 
Leprosy
Tuberculosis
A minute germ (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) causes TB, and it can affect any part of our body. But lungs TB is the most common form. 
Modes of spread
It spreads from one person to other through tiny droplets in air, when breathing. A TB patient’s sputum has thousands of TB germs, and while 
coughing or sneezing the TB germs spread in the air. The germs also stay 
in dust for long and affect people. TB germs enter the lungs of healthy persons, when they breathe. Not all persons so affected will manifest disease. In a weak 
person the germs multiply and produce an illness. It may take months to 
develop illness after the germ has infected the person.
Common signs and symptoms
The symptoms of lungTB are:
l Cough with sputum for two weeks or more
l Pain in chest
l Sometimes the presence of blood stained sputum (haemoptysis) with symptoms like:
l Rise in evening temperature
l Night sweats
l Loss of weight
l Loss of appetite.
A person with cough for two weeks or more is a suspect for TB and should be 
referred to a PHC/CHC/DH for the confirmation of diagnosis. Sputum examination 
is main tool for diagnosing lung TB. X-ray and other investigations may be needed in cases when sputum test is negative and the patient continues to exhibit disease 
symptoms.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,60,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 60Management of TB 
Both drugs and 
nourishment is needed for 
cure of persons infected 
with TB. Under current ‘DOTS treatment’ one has 
to take the medicines in 
front of a non-related DOTS provider who could be an 
ANM or MPW or an ASHA. 
The improvement occurs in few weeks. However, the 
full treatment takes 6 to 8 
months in most cases. It is critical to make sure that the patient completes the full treatment, otherwise he/she will not be fully cured and illness will come 
back and will still spread the TB germs. During treatment the sputum is tested 
periodically for germs of TB. 
Table B in Annexure 11 contains the details on side effects of common TB Drugs.
ASHAs role
l Identify and refer patients for suspected cases of TB
l If you are a DOTS provider you need to ensure compliance for the 
treatment- Make sure that medicines are taken regularly by the patient for 
6-9 months 
l Counsel on patient taking extra nutrition
l Build awareness to prevent spread of TB by telling infected persons:
l To cover the mouth with handkerchief while coughing and sneezing to 
halt spread of germs.
l To eat and drink from a separate set of utensils which should be washed separately. 
l To avoid spitting in nearby open space and prevent spread of infection covering his or her mouth with a clean cloth, especially while coughing. 
This prevents spread of droplets in the surroundings. The cloth should be 
washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis. 
l To avoid close contact with spouse, children and infants and the elderly within the family for at least first two months after starting treatment. 
l About BCG vaccination at birth that prevents serious forms of TB. 
l Providing support and care to persons with TB and not stigmatising those affected.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,61,"61 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Leprosy
What is Leprosy?
l It is a chronic infectious disease caused by a bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.
l It usually affects the skin and peripheral nerves, but has a wide range of 
clinical manifestations.
Common signs and symptoms of Leprosy: The signs differ greatly according to the person’s natural resistance to the disease. The first sign of Leprosy is usually in the skin:
l One or more white spots or dark coloured patches, with loss of sensation in the affected area of the skin.
l Body parts usually affected include hands and feet, face, ears, wrist, elbows, buttocks and knees. Loss of sensation could be so severe that persons with 
Leprosy sometimes burn themselves without knowing it.
l In advanced cases hands and feet become partly paralysed and claw-like. 
Fingers and toes may gradually become shorter and become stumps.
Modes of spread
Leprosy is spread by skin to skin contact, through sneezing and coughing. The germs are found in the inner lining of the nose and in the skin of untreated 
persons. Germs once inside may not manifest the disease up to a period of  
5-7 years.
Types of Leprosy
Paucibacillary: Usually single skin lesion is seen or those with two to five skin lesions
Mulitbacillary: When more than five lesions are present
Management
It Involves: Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) using combination of drugs. It is a long 
treatment and requires constant follow ups.
ASHAs role
l ASHAs are involved in the eradication programme for Leprosy to mobilise all suspected individuals for a medical examination and further management 
which includes completion of the long course of treatment. A good way to 
do this is ask anyone with skin lesion to show to a doctor especially if there is diminished sensation. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,62,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 62l Counselling for leprosy patients for regularity/completion of treatment and 
prevention of disability.
l You must include following key messages when you talk to people about Leprosy:
l It is the least infectious of all infectious diseases, and it does not spread through casual touch.
l It is completely curable with MDT.
l Early detection and regular treatment with MDT prevents deformities and disabilities due to leprosy.
l MDT is available free of cost at all Govt. health centres/dispensaries/hospitals on all working days.
l Social rehabilitation of the leprosy afflicted persons should be supported by all individual to prevent any sort of discrimination.
l Treated leprosy patients can continue to live at home and do normal work.
l Former leprosy patients with mutilated hands/feet who received treatment earlier do not suffer from active disease and do not transmit 
leprosy. They do not need MDT again.
Malaria 
What is Malaria?
Malaria is one of the major public health problems of the country. It is an 
infection caused by a parasite (micro-organsim) called Plasmodium. But it can 
be treated if effective treatment is started early. Delay in treatment may lead to 
serious consequences including death. Prompt and effective treatment is also important for controlling the transmission of malaria.
There are two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very 
dangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs.
How does it spread?
When the mosquito bites an infected person, the parasite enters the mosquito’s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’s stomach and later when it bites another 
person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’s saliva 
and infects him/her.
Signs and symptoms
l The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with 
Falciparum type infection. Sometimes the patient has continuous fever.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,63,"63 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l Malaise and headache usually accompanies fever.
l Malaria affects more frequently and more severely children below five years, 
pregnant women, or patients who are already ill.
l Falciparum malaria can affect the brain: causing clouding of consciousness, fits, or paralysis leading to death.
In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant mothers and malnourished children are at greater risk.
Any person living in a malaria affected area, who develops fever must be 
suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and rigor and headache, it is 
even more likely.
Managing Malaria
How to confirm:  There are two ways of confirming malaria through blood test; 
(This will be taught to you in future trainings)
l Making a blood smear- Annexure 12
l Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit- Annexure 13
RDT is to be done or smears are to be taken before starting treatment. 
Treating Malaria
Paracetamol should be given for fever, and sponging with warm water should be done to bring down temperature when needed. If RDT is positive for 
malaria- Chloroquine or Artesunate Combination treatment (ACT) treatment 
should be given. Your local health department would tell you which of the two possible treatments should be chosen. If despite treatment fever does not 
begin to come down within two or three days, or persists even after a week, 
the patient must seek treatment from a hospital. (Treatment guidelines for Malaria are provided in Table C – Annexure 10)
Prevention of Malaria
Mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito 
that transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at 
night. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in 
clean water. In rainy season, wherever water collects, it forms a good breeding 
place for mosquitoes. It also breeds in well in streams, rice fields and  
over-head water tanks."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,64,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 64Ways of controlling malaria: There are two ways:
Do not allow mosquito to 
multiply
l Not allowing water to 
stagnate, and pouring a 
spoon of oil over the water 
surface in small collections. This is enough to kill the 
mosquito larvae.
l Drying up or filling breeding 
pits.
l Enable cultivation of Gambusia fish or larva eating 
fish in ponds and Wells - these eat up the mosquito larvae. Also remove the 
grass and vegetation from banks of pond. Larvae find it difficult to breed if there is no vegetation and the pond edges are vertical.
l Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in one place and it should be flushed and cleaned once in a week.
Do not allow mosquitoes to bite by using
l Clothes that cover the body, like full sleeves shirts.
l Mosquito nets treated with insecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net 
may die later.
l Mosquito repellent, eg.burning neem leaves to drive mosquitoes away.
l Insecticide spray on walls and places where mosquitoes sit so that they do not 
reproduce and die before biting more people.
The role of ASHA in prevention of Malaria
l In the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme ASHAs are involved in diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases on a day to day 
basis. You are expected to screen for fever cases suspected to be suffering 
from malaria, using RDTs and blood slides and to administer anti-malarial treatment to positive cases
l During house visits and in the village meetings you should inform the community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. 
Encourage and help the village health and sanitation committee and the 
women’s groups or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. Where possible, ask 
those with fever, who you suspect of having malaria to go to the primary 
health centre.

Maternal HealthSection 8
8.1 Care During Pregnancy/Ante Natal Care
Pregnancy is a natural event in the life of a woman. If a pregnant woman is in 
good health and gets appropriate care she is likely to have a healthy pregnancy 
and a healthy baby. 
Pregnancy diagnosis
Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as 
possible after the first missed period. The benefit of 
early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be 
registered early by the ANM and start getting antenatal care soon. 
There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early
l Missed Periods 
l Pregnancy testing- through use of the Nischay 
home pregnancy test kit (Annexure14)
l The Nischay test kit can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. The test can be done 
immediately after the missed period. 
l A positive test means that the woman is 
pregnant. A negative test means that the woman 
is not pregnant.
l In case she is not pregnant and does not want to 
get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a 
family planning method. 
l The result of the test should be kept confidential.

 66Schedule and services to be provided during ante natal care 
and check-up
Schedule of ANC visits 
Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first 
three month period. The suggested schedule for ANC is as below:
Services to be provided during ANC (at the VHND or in the facility)
l  Complete history of the current and previous pregnancy ,  and any 
medical/surgical problem in the past should be obtained. 
l  Weight, blood pressure, blood test for Haemoglobin (to detect 
anaemia), urine test and abdominal examination should be recorded on 
every ANC visit .
l  100 Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets and Tetanus toxoid (TT) Injections. In the 
first pregnancy first TT injection is given as early as possible and the second 
is given four weeks after the first one. In the next pregnancy only one dose 
(booster) is to be given if the pregnancy happens in first three years of previous one.
l  Counselling on nutritious diet and proper rest.
By carrying out a complete pregnancy check-up, the ANM is able to detect 
problems and decide on referring the woman to a doctor.l  1st visit: Within 12 weeks—preferably 
as soon as pregnancy is suspected—for 
registration of pregnancy and first antenatal 
check-up. This is also the time when maternal and child protection card is to be 
made.
l  2nd visit: Between 14 and 26 weeks
l  3rd visit: Between 28 and 34 weeks 
l  4th visit: After 36 weeks
ANC can be done at Vilage Health and 
Nutrition Day (VHND) or the nearest health 
institution such as the Sub centre. It is 
advisable for the pregnant woman to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at an appropriate health 
centre for the third antenatal visit, as well as availing of the required investigations."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,67,"67 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Anaemia - Anaemia is very common among 
women, adolescent girls and malnourished 
children. 
l Anaemia is due to a reduced level of haemoglobin in the blood. Haemoglobin 
is a substance in the blood that carries 
oxygen which is important for all body functions. The amount of haemoglobin 
can be tested by a simple blood test, which 
the ANM in the health sub-centre or a lab technician in a health facility will do. Low 
haemoglobin can lead to complications in 
pregnant women and can even result in the death of mother and baby. A woman 
with anaemia looks pale, feels tired, 
complains of breathlessness on doing routine work, and might have swelling on 
the face and body. 
l To prevent anaemia, all pregnant women 
need to take one iron tablet daily, starting 
after three months of pregnancy. In this 
way, she must take atleast 100 IFA tablets. 
l Anaemia which is mild or moderate is treated with iron tablets (more than 200 Danger signs during ante-natal period

l  Other Illnesses such as Heart disease, jaundice or fever etc.
IFA tablets), which have to be taken daily for many months during pregnancy or by giving injections.
l If the anaemia is severe, hospitalisation for blood transfusion will be required. 
l All pregnant women should be encouraged to take iron rich foods. These 
include as green leafy vegetables, whole 
pulses, jaggery, ragi, meat and liver etc as well as fruits rich in Vitamin C – mango, 
guava, orange and sweet lime etc. 
l While giving iron tablets, the woman 
should be advised that some side effects 
might occur. However, they can be 
managed in the following ways: 
l Nausea, occasional vomiting, mild diarrhoea - can be reduced by 
taking the tablet after meals. 
l Constipation - can be reduced by 
drinking more water and eating fruits. 
l Black coloured stools - reassure the woman that it is not abnormal.
l Iron tablets should not be taken with tea, coffee, milk or calcium tablet. "

 68Role of ASHAs
l	List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest 
families, and in the sections which tend to get left out, e.g. women from 
SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main village, or 
in hamlets that fall between villages, newly migrant women and women headed households.
l	Early registration: Help pregnant women getting registered as early as possible but within 12 weeks of pregnancy. 
l	Ensuring full ANC: You should educate women about the importance of the four ANC visits. Remind them when next ANC is due and/or escort them 
to VHND if they need such support. Ensure that all components of ANC are 
delivered and the Maternal Card is updated.
l	Counselling for ante-natal care: Counsel the pregnant women and  family on:
l	Importance of a balanced and nutritious diet: The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including 
beans and nuts), vegetables, milk, eggs, meat and fish. If possible, the 
mother should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be 
forbidden during pregnancy.
l	Importance of adequate rest and harmful effects of heavy manual 
labour: Pregnant women should not carry out heavy manual labour, like 
working on construction sites, brick kilns, etc and take adequate rest for 
better growth of the baby.
l	Danger signs during pregnancy: If she has any of the danger signs discussed earlier she should be referred to the appropriate health 
facility. 
l	Supplementary Ration from Anganwadi Centre (AWC): Ensure that all 
pregnant women receive this entitlement from their nearest centre. 
l	Extra care for pregnant adolescent girls: They are more likely to be under-nourished and therefore suffer problems during delivery. They 
need extra help for safe delivery at a health facility.
l	Safe institutional delivery: You should promote safe institutional 
delivery for all pregnant women in the community and help them in 
making birth plans for the time of delivery. During the pregnancy period 
itself, you should discuss this with the family.
l	The available institutions providing different levels of care close to the village."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,69,"69 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l	Transport options available in the area.
l	Estimated expenditure and possible funding sources if required.
Some women are at a higher risk of developing complications during 
delivery and they must be specially counselled to go for institutional 
delivery. These include:
l Adolescent girls (below 19 years of age)
l Women who are over 40 years of age
l Women who already have three children
l Women who do not gain enough weight or have excessive weight gain. 
Delivery Care 
Delivery occurs normally after nine months of 
pregnancy. In case the delivery happens before 
time, special care for baby is required. You should 
motivate every pregnant woman in your area to go to an appropriate health facility for delivery since 
labour complications may suddenly occur even if 
the pregnancy was normal. These complications can threaten the life of mother, baby or both. The priority 
is to ensure that the mother is shifted immediately to 
a well-equipped hospital.
In case the family needs you to accompany them to 
the institution for delivery and it is feasible for you to 
do so, you should escort the family to the institution 
at the time of delivery. Pregnant women should get benefits under schemes 
like the Janani Sishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK), and the Janani Suraksha 
Yojana (JSY). These are described in next section.
Some women choose to give birth at home even after much persuasion. 
Your responsibility in these cases to help the woman have a safe and 
clean labour, delivery and post-partum experience. The most important 
component of making a home delivery safe is to ensure that the delivery  
is conducted by a Skilled Birth Attendant such as ANM, staff nurse or  
doctor. Another important component is to have a plan for referral if complication arises."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,70,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 70Two important health schemes of the Government for the 
mothers and newborn
Janani Suraksha Y ojana (JSY)
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is an entitlement under the National Rural 
Health Mission (NRHM), whose objective is to reduce maternal and neo-
natal mortality by promoting institutional delivery among poor pregnant 
women. The entitlement is available to all women who deliver in public 
health facility regardless of their age and parity. JSY scheme provides for a cash payment for any poor woman who delivers in any public health 
institution or in any JSY accredited private institution. You as the ASHA 
are also entitled to an incentive of Rs. 300, if you motivate women for completing all ante-natal check ups and Rs. 300 for facilitating her delivery 
in health institution. Escort is voluntary and not mandatory for ASHA. In case 
of an urban area ASHA will get Rs. 200 incentive for motivating women for completing all ante-natal check ups and Rs. 200 for facilitating her delivery 
in health institution. In case of home deliveries only the BPL women are 
entitled for the cash payment. You will be told by your trainers during training about the specific scheme related entitlements in your state.
JSSK – Janani Sishu Suraksha Karyakaram
JSSK entitles all pregnant women who deliver in public health institution and 
all sick newborn to completely cashless services. The scheme was launched to eliminate the high out of pocket expenditures made by poor families for 
accessing health care services at public health institutions.l Clean hands
l Clean New blade
l Clean surface
l Clean cord l Clean cord stump - Nothing 
should be applied on the cord 
stump after deliveryIn case of a home delivery it is essential that five cleans are followed:"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,71,"71 Induction Training Module for ASHAs The following services would be provided free at the public health institution 
for all pregnant and delivered mothers and for sick newborn and infants up 
to one year of age:
Entitlements for Pregnant woman and sick newborns and infants up to 
one year of age 
Free and zero expense delivery and caesarean sectionFree transport would be provided from home to the government facility,

home
Free drugsFree consumables like gloves, syringes etcFree diagnostics – Blood test, urine test, ultra-sonography etc.Free provision of bloodFree diet (upto 3 days for normal delivery and 7 days for caesareanExemption from all kinds of user charges 
Y our role – You should inform the community about these schemes and their 
entitlements. You should make them aware that they do not have to make any 
formal or informal payments at the facility for accessing delivery services or for treatment of sick newborn (0-30 days of birth). You should help them in getting 
these entitlements and also start action if there is any denial of services or 
demand for payment. 
Post-natal Care
Post-natal period is the period after delivery of the placenta up to six weeks (42 days) after birth. During this period mother and newborn could get some 
problems. You should be aware of these, so that they 
can be guided for treatment and referral. 
Tasks of ASHAs during this period
Home Visits
l		You should visit the mother and newborn from the time of birth till six weeks after the delivery 
and provide counselling for appropriate care of 
the mother and newborn.

l	For Institutional Delivery visit on Days - 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42.
Important messages for post-natal mothers
Counsel the mother on following:
l		Nutritious diet: Counsel the mother to eat more than her usual diet .She 
can eat any kind of food but it is important to include high protein food like 
pulses and legumes, foods of animal sources etc. and plenty of fluids. 
l		Adequate rest: Encourage her and the family to let her rest for at least six 
weeks after birth
l		Exclusive breastfeeding: (details would be discussed in subsequent chapter)
l		Adopting family planning methods/contraceptives: Help the couple in deciding the method best suited for them and help them in accessing the 
required contraceptive services. 
l		Postnatal check-ups: Counsel the mother that she must be seen by the 
ANM for at least three post-natal check ups.
l		Timely birth registration: This is done by the Panchayat. Support her if she needs it. 
l		Free supplementary food from Anganwadi centre: You should inform and ensure that every lactating mother is aware of this entitlement and gets 
the services, by working with the Anganwadi worker. 
l		Possible complications of this period: You should inform mother for signs 
of complications (discussed below) and ensure appropriate referral
Complications during post-natal period
Some women can develop complications after the child birth. You should look 
for the following symptoms during this period to identify complications :
l Excessive bleeding 
l Fever 
l Foul smelling 
discharge 
l Severe abdominal pain
l Fits/Convulsionsl Anaemia – lack of haemoglobin in blood
l Sore breasts/cracked nipples/any other problem related to breastfeeding

Newborn CareSection 9
Every newborn needs care immediately at birth and in the first 28 days of life, 
irrespective of mode of delivery or weight of baby. In this section you will learn 
the basic aspects of the newborn care. Future rounds of training will cover 
this topic more extensively and help you build additional skills for providing newborn care.
Care of the Normal Baby
Immediate care of the newborn at birth              
Immediate care at the time of birth involves clearing the nose and mouth of mucous, to allow the baby to breathe. Sometimes, the 
newborn can die immediately after birth due to asphyxia (difficulty in 
breathing). The ANM or the doctors attending the birth usually clear the airway and resuscitate the baby. In case of a home delivery, where 
there is no skilled birth attendant you should immediately refer the 
baby to the nearest health facility, as in such circumstances the time to save the baby is very short.
Normal care at birth
l  Drying the newborn: Baby should be cleaned gently with a clean soft moist cloth and the head wiped dry with a dry soft clean cloth. 
l  Ensuring warmth: The baby should be kept warm and in close skin to skin contact with the mother. It should be wrapped in several layers of clothing 
or woollen clothing depending upon the season. The room should be warm 
enough for an adult person to just feel uncomfortable; free from moisture and strong wind. The family and mother should be counselled to avoid 
bathing the baby till at least first seven days after birth. A newborn loses 
body heat very quickly and if it is left wet or exposed, its body temperature may fall suddenly and cause sickness which can kill the baby. 
l  Early initiation of breastfeeding: Mother should be encouraged to start breastfeeding immediately after delivery. This is beneficial for both the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,74,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 74mother and baby since it not only makes the baby stronger but also helps 
in quick delivery of placenta and reduces bleeding. The first yellow thick 
milk of the mother known as colostrum should be fed to the baby and not 
discarded as it prevents the baby from infections. 
l  Avoiding pre lacteal feeds: Honey, sugar water etc. should not be given to the baby since they can cause infection or diarrhoea. Only breast milk 
should be fed to the baby. 
l  Weigh the baby: Baby should weighed immediately after birth. If the 
weight of the baby is 2500 gms then it is a normal baby. But if the weight is 
less than 2500 gms then special precautions have to be taken, which will be 
taught to you subsequently.
Home visits for the care of newborn
You should undertake home visits to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, 
discourage harmful practices such as bottle feeds, early baths, giving other 
substances by mouth. Frequent home visits will help you to identify early signs of infection or other illnesses in the newborn. 
For institutional births-visit on Days - 3, 7,14, 21, 28 and 42.
For home deliveries visit on Days - 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42.
Care of the High Risk Baby
A high risk baby is the one who is:
l  Having less than 2000 gms birth weight
l  Not able to suckle or breast feed properly on day 1.
l  Pre term baby - born before completion of  
8 month 14, days. 
These babies need extra care. You should visit such babies on daily basis in the first week after birth. Visit the baby once every 
three days until she is 28 days old. If the baby is improving then one visit is 
undertaken on the 42
nd day.
Care for the high risk baby includes:
l  Extra warmth: You can advise mother and family to adopt the Kangaroo care (Skin to skin contact)- method to keep the baby warm. Request the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,75,"75 Induction Training Module for ASHAsmother to sit or recline comfortably if possible in a private place, and loosen 
her upper garments. Place the baby on mother’s chest in an upright and 
extended posture, between her breasts, so that the baby skin is in direct 
contact with the mother skin. Turn baby’s head to one side to keep airways clear. Cover the baby with mother’s blouse, ‘pallu’ or gown; wrap the baby-
mother together with an added blanket or shawl. If mother is not present 
then you can advise father or any other adult of the family to provide kangaroo care to the baby. The head of the baby should be covered with a 
cloth or cap to prevent heat loss.
l  Caution during bathing: For Low birth weight and Pre-term babies, 
bathing should be delayed after the usual seven days, till a steady weight 
gain is recorded and the baby attains a weight of over 2000 gms. 
l  Frequent breast feeds: Babies with low birth weight may not be able to 
breastfeed in the beginning and need to be given expressed breast milk 
using a spoon. As they gradually learn to suckle they should be put to breast 
as often as possible.
l  Early identification and referral for danger signs: Counsel the  
mother to identify the following danger signs. If any of the following 
danger signs appear in the baby then it should be immediately referred 
to a well -equipped health facility for proper care. 
l Poor sucking of breast 
l Pus on Umbilicus
l Pus filled boils
l Develops fever 
l Fast breathing/difficulty in 
breathing/chest wall in drawing 
l Develops diarrhoea or has blood in stool 
l Pallor of palms/soles (jaundice)
l Blue palms/solesl Remains excessively drowsy or cries incessantly
l Feels cold or hot to touch 
l Bleeding from any site 
l Abdominal distension/vomits often
l Abnormal movements (convulsions)
l No urine passed in 48 hours 
l Cracks or redness on the skin folds (thigh axilla/buttock)"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,76,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 76Precautions during referral:
l  Choose the fastest mode of transport. 
l  Keep the baby warm during travelling. 
l  Mother should accompany and stay close to the baby and breast feed the 
baby whenever required.
Other precautions to be taken for newborn care:
l  The cord of the baby should be kept clean and dry at all times. Nothing should be applied on the cord of the baby, it should be kept clean and dry at 
all times. 
l  Nothing should be put in the eye of the baby.
l  Newborn baby should be kept away from people or children who are sick.
l  The newborn baby should not be taken to very crowded places. 
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding should be started within half an hour after the birth. Baby should 
be put to the breast even before the placenta is delivered. The first thick milk 
– colostrum - should always be fed to the baby. Many people discard this milk 
due to cultural beliefs but it should never be discarded. Colostrum builds the immunity of the baby and protects from diseases. 
Facts about breastfeeding
l  The baby should be exclusively breast fed till six months of age and 
no other outside feed should be given. 
l  Breast milk provides for all the dietary needs of the baby. It also provides sufficient water to the baby, thus baby should not be given 
water even on summer days.
l  It is safe, builds immunity against illnesses, helps in keeping the 
baby warm and helps develop a bond between mother and baby.
l  Feeding other than breast milk may cause infections and malnutrition due to poor nutritious content. The baby may have difficulty in digesting such 
foods resulting in diarrhoea and vomiting. 
l  Breastfeeding should be done as often as baby wants and for as long as the 
baby wants, through the day and night."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,77,"77 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl  The more often the baby is fed, more milk will be produced. 
l  Breastfeeding helps in contraction of the uterus, expulsion of the placenta 
and also reduces the risk of excessive bleeding after delivery. 
l  At six months of age other foods should be introduced. Breastfeeding can be continued till the child is 1-2 years of age. 
Correct positioning for breastfeeding
The mother’s hand should hold the baby supporting the baby’s bottom, and not just the head or shoulders. The baby’s face should face the breast, with nose 
opposite the nipple, chin touching the breast, mouth is wide open and the lips 
upturned. 
To obtain maximum benefit of breastfeeding, the baby should be held in the 
correct position and be put correctly to the breast. Explain to the mother the 
correct position for breastfeeding. The pictures below explain how the baby is held in different positions.
Breastfeeding Positions
Cradle Position Side-lying Position
Underarm Position Alternate Underarm Position
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,78,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 78Mother should follow the following steps while breastfeeding the baby every 
time:
l  Clean the nipple of the breast with warm water before feed. 
l  Hold the baby horizontal on the lap or besides if the mother is lying on side. 
l  Hold the breast at the root of the nipple. Put the baby’s mouth to the breast so that the baby gets a full hold of the nipple now.
l  Make sure the baby’s head and body is held facing the breast without turn and twist. Support the baby’s head and bottom. 
Common problems in breastfeeding
Some mothers may find it difficult to breast feed their baby normally. You should counsel such mothers and encourage them. Listen to them, understand 
their problems and give advice clearly and simply. 
The common problems reported are:
l  Not enough milk 
l  Sore nipples and 
l  Engorged and painful breasts 
Encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding when she complains of not 
enough milk. Maintaining the correct position during breastfeeding will prevent 
sore nipples. If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast, gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk until the 
areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the attachment is 
correct. If the problem persists refer the mother to ANM for advice."

Infant and Young Child NutritionSection 10
Malnutrition
One-third of the world’s undernourished children live in India. About 46% of the 
children below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly 
one out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under 
nutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, 
adolescence and adulthood.
Facts about malnutrition in young children
l  Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the 
contributory factors to over half of all child deaths.
l  Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they find it more difficult to 
get healthcare and also there is less time for child care.
l  Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using their 
scarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition.
l  Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the 
grandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue.
l  It is easier to prevent a child from slipping into malnutrition than to reverse 
it once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on counselling 
every family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this 
time, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.
Recognising malnutrition
It is difficult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it is too "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,80,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 80late. Most children look normal but their height and weight when measured 
is less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child 
monthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the 
child can be classified as mild, moderate or severely underweight.
Sick children need special attention. However, families of all children especially 
children below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent 
malnutrition.
Six important messages for preventing child malnutrition
1. Exclusive Breastfeeding
l  Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; not even water 
should be added.
2. Complementary Feeding
l  At the age of six months, add other foods. Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least 
one to two years more. There are five things to remember about 
complementary feeding:
l Consistency: Initially the food has to be so_ and mashed. But later, anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less 
spices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. 
‘give daal not daal ka pani’ .
l Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as 
the mother.
l Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given 
should be equal to about half what the adult needs in terms of 
nutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has 
to be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day.
l Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family 
could add a spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever 
edible oil is available in the house is sufficient.
l Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the greener it is, or the more red it is the more its 
protective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, fish are liked by children 
and very nutritive and protective.
3. Feeding during the illness
l  Give as much as the child will take; do not reduce the quantity of food. After the illness, to catch up with growth, add an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a 
major cause of malnutrition."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,81,"81 Induction Training Module for ASHAs 4. Prevent illness
l  Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are six important 
things to remember which could prevent illness:
l Hand washing: before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s food, and after cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the 
single most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea. 
l Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of 
particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.
l Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that 
cause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are 
more common and life threatening, than in normal children.
l Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and then repeated once every six months till five years of age. This too 
reduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in 
malnourished children. 
l Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during 
the illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more 
rigorous in hand washing and more careful in handling the baby. 
l Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of 
malnutrition. You should encourage parents and other family members 
to spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the 
child. Such children eat and absorb food better.
5. Access to health services
l Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. On the 
very first day of the illness, if you help the mother decide on whether it is a 
minor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be referred 
to a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.
l Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a 
much higher chance of the children being malnourished.
6. Access to anganwadi services
l The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the age 
of 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,82,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 82Malnourished children are to be given additional food supplements. For 
children below the age of two, take – home rations are to be given. Even 
pregnant women and lactating mothers up to six months are entitled to 
get food supplements in the anganwadi centres. _ Weighing the baby 
and informing the family of the level of malnutrition is another important 
anganwadi service. 
l The anganwadi is also the site where the Village Health and Nutrition Day 
(VHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is given 
immunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) 
packets or drugs needed for illness management.
Note
Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families 
tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very 
costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally 
available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors 
for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could 
also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.
Counselling on Malnutrition
All the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, 
many of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not 
be possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps; first an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding 
of this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.
For an analysis, we need to know the following
l  What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, 
moderately underweight or severely underweight?
l  What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?
l  What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?
l  What is the family’s access to the three key services? (ICDS, Health Services and Public Distribution Services)"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,83,"83 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Skills in Eliciting Information
There is a skill of asking each question so as to get the right 
information.
What the child is being fed
l  Ask specifically what was fed in the last one day, starting from now and recalling backwards, till the previous day.
Things to notice: how many feedings in a day, how much in each feed, whether the child’s food included pulses, vegetables, oil.
l  Ask specifically about protective foods which are not given daily.
l  Ask about feeding during illness
Illness and treatment
l  Ask whether the child fell ill during past six months (ask specifically about diarrhoea, fever, cold and cough). Start with 
most recent illness, and then ask them to recall backwards –“ 
before this when was he/she sick? etc.
l  What actions did the family take during illness? Which provider did they go to?
l  What difficulties did the family face in accessing healthcare and how much did it cost?
l  What are the likely inessential services or expenditures which they are getting into?
Access to Anganwadi Services
l  Is the child taken regularly every month to the 
Anganwadi Centre (AWC) for weighing? Have they 
seen the growth curve?
l  Is the family availing of food supplements from the anganwadi, is it regular, reliable and of variety needed and reasonable quality?
Skill in analysis
Based upon the replies to these questions, you will form an understanding of the multiple causes of malnutrition in that specific c child. It is never one factor, 
it is many. Do not jump immediately to some point and start giving your advice. 
Ask all the questions, listen to the replies fully, think about it and then only give your advice.
Discuss what measures are needed in each case and how this is to be conveyed?"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,84,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 84Given below are examples of understanding that 
ASHA formed in two children
Banu was a nine month old girl with moderate malnutrition. She is 
being breastfed and only this month was started on complementary 
food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, 
once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she 
became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations 
from there. Her immunisation is on schedule. 
Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has 
no odema, but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital 
because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being 
breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a 
roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite.
He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. 
His immunisation schedule is complete.
How to give advice
l  First praise the mother for how well she is coping with the child and 
reinforce the good practices she is following. Praise must always precede 
any other advice."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,85,"85 Induction Training Module for ASHAs l  Then deliver each message as needed for that child in the form of a 
suggestion and ask whether they could implement it. Dialogue with the 
family explaining why the step is needed and how they could achieve it. If 
they are convinced, they would agree. If not convinced or unable to agree, move on to the next message. It takes more than one visit and one dialogue 
for families to agree, even if it was possible.
l  Then point out any harmful or wasteful practices, explaining why you say so.
l  Arrange for a follow-up visit to see how many practices have changed and 
to further reinforce the messages. Each family with a malnourished child 
needs to be met about once or twice a month.
l  Arrange for mother and child to meet the ANM or the doctor as required. 
Such a visit is required in the following circumstances: 
l  Any child who is severely underweight. If, in addition, there are danger signs, admission in a facility which manages such children would be 
desirable.
l Any child who is underweight, who does not gain weight even after a 
few months of trying to follow the advice.
l Any child who is underweight, who has fever, or chronic cough or persistent anaemia.
Even if the family is not going to see the doctor or ANM, do inform the Anganwadi Worker (AWW) and the ANM so that they can follow-up too.
This work is equally their work also.
How you should NOT give advice
Do not prescribe advice without dialogue—just telling families what to do 
would not help…
Do not give very broad and what can be perceived as ‘insulting’ advice like– 
“you must take care of your child, or you must keep the child clean, or you must give nutritious food etc.”
Anaemia in the young child
Anaemia is important to diagnose because it commonly comes along with malnutrition. It may be a cause of poor appetite. Blood 
testing is essential, but even in its absence based on observation of 
pallor alone, treatment can be started.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,86,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 86Looking for anaemia in children
Unusual paleness (Pallor) of the skin of the soles or palms is a sign of anaemia.
l  To see if the child has anaemia, look at the skin of the child’s palm. Hold the 
child’s palm open by grasping it gently from side to side.
l  Do not stretch the fingers backward. This may cause pallor.
l  Compare the child’s palm with your own palm and the palm of other children. If the skin is paler than of others, the child has pallor.
Treatment for anaemia is to give one tablet of paediatric iron daily. And also give one tablet of Albendazole for deworming once in six months. For a child less than two years, give half a tablet of Albendazole (Refer Annexure11 ). Iron 
rich foods are also needed for the young child. If anaemia does not improve, 
the child must be referred to a doctor for more complete blood tests and treatment.

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,87,"87 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Assessment of Malnutrition
ALL sick children should be assessed for signs suggesting malnutrition.
Check for Malnutrition 
Look and Feel:
l Look for visible severe wasting.
l Look for oedema of both feet.
l Determine grade of malnutrition by plotting weight for age (with AWW)
Identifying visible severe wasting
l  A child with visible severe wasting is very thin, has no fat, and looks like skin 
and bones. Some children are thin but do not have visible severe wasting. 
This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and referral to a hospital.
l  To look for visible severe wasting, remove the child’s clothes. Look for severe wasting of the muscles of the shoulders, arms, buttocks and legs. Look at the 
child from the side to see if the fat of the buttocks is missing. When wasting 
is extreme, there are many folds of skin on the buttocks and thigh.
l  The face of a child with visible severe wasting may still look normal. The child’s abdomen may be large or distended.
l  Look and feel to determine if the child has swelling of both feet. Use your thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. 
The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’s foot when you lift your 
thumb.
Determine grade of malnutrition
The AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child. Every child in the 
village should be weighed and his/her weight plotted on the growth chart. 
There is a separate chart for boys and for girls under the age of five years.
How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition
l  The left hand vertical line is the measure of the child’s weight.
l  The bottom line of the chart shows the child’s age in months.
l  Find the point on the chart where the line for the child’s weight meets the 
line for the child’s age.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,88,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 88Decide where the point is in relation to the curves
l  If the point is below the bottom most (-3SD) curve, the child is severely 
underweight.
l  If the point is between 2nd and 3rd curve or exactly on the 3rd curve, the child is moderately underweight.
l  If the point is on or above the curve marked zero or between the curve zero and -2SD (second curve) or exactly on the 2nd curve, then the child is 
normal.
Community level care for a malnourished child
All children who are underweight, should receive the following
l  Nutritional counselling as discussed earlier
l  Prompt treatment for all illnesses
l  Periodic weight measurement to ensure weight gain and detect worsening 
early.
l De-worming tabs (Albendazole): Half tablet of albendazole for a child less than two years old and one tablet for all children above two. 
l Based on the prevalence of worm infestations in the different areas the State as per their guideline will decide the deworming regime for 
malnourished/anaemic children. (see-Annexure-11)
l Paediatric Iron and Folic Acid Tablets: Daily one for three months.
l A dose of Vitamin A: If this has not been given.
Remember
Those children who are moderately underweight should be taken to a 
24x 7 PHC or a higher facility for medical consultation. Children who are 
severely malnourished need prompt hospitalisation in a centre which 
manages such children. This is often the District Hospital. "

Immunisation is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods of 
preventing diseases. The six vaccine preventable diseases are: 
l  Tetanus 
l  Poliomyelitis 
l  Diphtheria 
l  Pertussis (whooping cough)
l  Measles 
l  Childhood tuberculosis 
The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the 
full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the 
child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunisation schedule given in 
table below. 
If a child is not given the right vaccines in time, it is necessary to get them 
started whenever possible and complete the primary immunisation before the 
child reaches its first birthday.

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,92,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 92Role of ASHA in Immunisation
(a) Make a list of pregnant women, newborns 
and children up to two years eligible for 
different vaccines.
(b) Visit all families once in six months 
at least to update this list. After every 
immunisation session (VHND) update both 
the village register and the child’s health card. 
(c) Ensure that immunisation is discussed during every home visit in homes where there is a child under one year of age.
(d) Remind mother when the immunisation is due and alert her to the date when the VHND is being held.
(e) If needed, escort the mother and baby to the VHND on the date when the vaccine is due. This is important for families who do not access services such as those from poor and marginalised communities.
(f ) Ensure that first dose of BCG and oral polio is given soon after the baby is born.
(g) Mobilising children for VHND:
(i) Find out from the ANM when her next visit is due. If ASHA has her 
mobile number, confirm it on previous or same day. 
(ii) You must ensure that poorest and most distant households receives special attention to access the service.
(iii) Some children are more likely to be left out than others. This includes 
physically or mentally challenged children, children of migrant families, 
children belonging to families considered of ‘lower status’ or different from the majority of the village. Such children and such families are said 
to be ‘marginalised’ . They need your special attention and assistance.
(iv) Some hamlets or urban slums/basti have neither ANM or Anganwadi 
centre/worker taking care of their health needs. As an immediate step 
to address the issue. This needs to be corrected. As an immediate step, 
a women representative of the hamlet/slum can be included into the ‘village health and sanitation committee’ . 
(v) The village health plan should help identify hamlets and communities that are under-serviced. We will learn about village health plans in a later module.

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,93,"93 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Common Childhood Illnesses
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is defined as passage of liquid or watery stools more 
than three times in a day. Passage of even one large watery 
motion among children can be labelled as diarrhoea. Normally 
there are three types of diarrhoea: 
l  Acute watery diarrhoea starts suddenly and may continue for a number of days. Most of these are self-limiting and will last 
for three to seven days. 
l  Persistent diarrhoea: If the diarrhoea is of 14 days or more duration, the 
child has severe persistent diarrhoea and should be referred to hospital. 
l  Dysentery: The child who is passing blood in the stools has dysentery. This child also needs immediate referral
Diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease among children under five years. 
Majority of the deaths in diarrhoea are due to dehydration (loss of water and 
minerals). Germs are the main cause of childhood diarrhoea. These germs come 
from unsafe drinking water, unclean feeding practices, bottle feeds etc. We can 
avoid these problems with help of families and the village community in tackling 
hygiene and sanitation issues.
Four golden rules to observe if a child has diarrhoea  
l Continue feeding
l Give extra fluids
l Give ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution)
l Refer in case of danger signs 
l Continue Feeding
l If the child is breastfed, mother should continue breast-feeding 
whenever the child wants. 
l If the child has started consuming other foods, continue feeding small quantities of these items. 
l After the child has recovered from diarrhoea, it should be given more food than normal to recoup from the illness. 
l Give extra fluids: like Dal ka Paani, lassi and plain boiled water etc.
l Give ORS: Advise the mother to give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) to the child in adequate quantities. Guide the mother for preparing ORS in the 
following way. "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,94,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs 
 94Making ORS
Nowadays, one litre plastic water bottles are available and can be used to

If the ORS packet is not available, teach the mother how to make home-made 
ORS: For one glass (200 ml) of water, add a pinch of salt and a spoon of sugar. 
(See in the diagram how a pinch of salt is taken with three fingers and how 
a spoon of sugar is measured). Alternatively, one litre of water with 50 gm of sugar (8 spoons) and 5 gm (a teaspoon ) of salt. A juice of half a lime can be 
squeezed in. Taste to see that it is not too salty, or too sugary. It should taste of 
tears. Spoon is taken as 5 ml. Measure this amount and ensure it comes to 5 ml.

the:
l Child’s condition worsens.
l Not able to breastfeed.
l Drinks poorly.
l Develops a fever.
l Has blood in the stool.
Diarrhoea can be prevented by 
l Giving exclusive breastfeeding for THE FIRST six months. 
l Maintaining personal hygiene and ensuring safety of water and food and keeping our surroundings clean.  How much ORS to give?  In addition to the usual fluid intake; give
l If the child is up to two months of age: five spoonfuls after every loose stool
l  If the child is 2.1 months- 2 years of age - give about half a cup after every loose   
stool (100 ml).
l Older children can have up to one cup (200 ml) after every stool.
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is an important cause of 
mortality and morbidity in children. Most children up to the age 
of five years are susceptible to ARI. If not treated in time some of 
them develop pneumonia, which can result in death. If the child 
has some or all of the following symptoms along with cough then 
you should refer the child immediately to the health centre: 
l Fever 
l Difficulty in breathing
l Chest Wall in-drawing 
Serious morbidity and death are preventable if it is identified early 
and referred and treated in time. "

 96Care during illness– You should visit such households frequently and monitor 
the status of the child’s health. Counsel the mother to take the following 
measures in order to take care of the child:
l Keep the child warm. 
l Give plenty of fluids and continue breast-feeding. 
l Feeding should be continued during illness and the frequency of feeding 
increased after illness
l Clear the nose if it interferes with feeding (use saline and a moistened wick to help soften the mucus). 
l Soothe the throat and relieve cough with a home remedy such as lemon  with honey and ginger, tulsi, warm water etc. 
l Control fever using Paracetamol. (See Annexure 11 for details)
l Keep the baby warm
If the child has any of the following danger signs then you should refer the parents 
urgently to the nearest health facility or accompany them to the health facility if 
required: 
l Fast breathing. 
l Difficulty in breathing. 
l Unable to drink.   
l Lethargy 
 l Chest wall indrawing"

Adolescent HealthSection 11
What is Adolescence?
Adolescence (10-19 years) is a phase of life characterised by acceleration of 
physical growth and psychological and behavioural changes which brings 
transformation from childhood to adulthood. It is a transition period of life 
where an individual is no longer a child, but not yet an adult
Developmental changes during adolescence
As a part of growing up, adolescents go through puberty. Puberty is the time in life when body changes from that of a child to an adult. These developmental 
changes occur under the influence of chemicals in our body called hormones. 
The changes are:
l  Physical Changes 
 In Girls: The body changes shape by becoming more rounded, the breasts 
grow, the hips widen, hair grows in the armpits and private parts. This 
happens between 10-16 years of age. The onset of menstruation (bleeding every month) is an important change occurring among girls during the 
adolescent years.
 In Boys: The shoulders widen, height increases suddenly, the voice changes 
and becomes deeper and hair begins to grow in the armpits, private parts 
and the face.
l  Emotional Changes: Include shyness, rapid mood changes, lack of 
confidence, attention seeking behaviour, strong peer influence, sexual 
attraction, desire to establish own identity and independent thinking. During 
this period unhealthy habits like smoking and drinking or experimenting with drugs and unsafe sex can also set in.
l  Social Changes: Conflicts with the family over control, strong influence of the peer group on behaviour and the formation of new relationship."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,98,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 98Why is it Important to Focus on Adolescent Health?
Adolescent years are formative years and set our physical, emotional, and 
behavioural patterns. Foundations of future health are laid in this period. 
Increasing awareness, practice of healthy behaviours, building self- esteem and 
confidence in this age group results in confident healthy adults.
Major adolescent health concerns
There are certain health issues which are specific to this age group and have to be managed appropriately. These include: 
Menstruation in girls
(Understanding Menstruation and Problems during menstruation)Menarche: The onset of puberty, when the girl has her first period is called 
Menarche and generally takes place between 9-16 years of age. During this 
period, most girls have bleeding for the first time from the vagina which becomes a periodic occurrence in a girl’s life. Each cycle of bleeding is observed 
in a gap of 28-40 days.
Why does menstruation occur?In a girls’ body at puberty, every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of 
the eggs from the ovary, travels through pipes called fallopian tube. This is 
called ovulation. As the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a soft spongy lining Note:
l The normal time for onset of puberty is 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 
years in boys.
l  These changes start 1-2 years earlier in girls as compared to boys. The rate and extent of change is variable in different individuals. In a group 
of individuals who are growing together this variation often leads to 
anxiety –“Am I normal?” and needs reassurance.
l Any cases showing delay, such as- menstruation not starting by 16 years in girls needs referral to a doctor. 
l Early onset of puberty signs in girls (before eight years) and boys (before nine years) is also a matter of concern and should be referred for further 
examination."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,99,"99 Induction Training Module for ASHAs gets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of tiny blood vessels. 
In case an egg and sperm meet to form an embryo, or a baby, that begins to 
grow in the uterus this lining provides the nutrition for the baby. If the egg is 
not joined by a sperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The unfertilised egg along with broken uterine lining is released as blood and flows out of 
the vagina. This bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called 
menstruation.
Menstrual Cycle
A menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. The typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short 
as 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which 
can vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.
Problems faced by girls during menstruation
The difficulties that girls may experience during menstruation are:Irregular Periods: For the first few years of menstruation, cycles are often 
irregular and usually become regular within two to three years after menarche. 
They may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). 
Heavy periods: Adolescents may have heavy periods lasting longer than eight 
days, often saturating the pad within an hour or passing large blood clots. This 
happens because of a slight imbalance in hormone secretion. It should normally stabilise in year or two. However, if this happens regularly, it leads to exhaustion 
as body is losing more blood than it is producing. The girl should then consult a 
doctor immediately.

 100Painful period: Some girls may experience nausea, headaches, diarrhoea 
and severe cramps during menstrual period. Usually, this lasts only for a day 
or two. For relief from these symptoms, a girl should try the  
following methods: 
l  Fill a plastic bottle with hot water, wrap it in a towel and place it on the 
abdomen,
l  Massage the abdomen
l  Local remedies such as drinking hot ginger tea
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)
This refers to a combination of physical and emotional symptoms experienced by women and girls during the menstrual cycle, usually just 
before bleeding begins. These symptoms include- temporary weight gain, 
feeling of heaviness in the body particularly breast, headaches, cramps, pain and mental irritability. It is important for you to make the girls understand 
that these symptoms begin five to seven days before the period starts and 
disappear before the bleeding begins. This can be managed with remedies for pain described above and eating a diet that is low in salt, and includes 
foods like leafy green vegetable and raw fruits and vegetables, which are 
low in sugar and high in fibre.
It is important for you to help the girls understand that 
menstruation is part of every woman’s life and there should be no 
shame or embarrassment around this. It is not to be seen as an obstacle 
to daily activities. There is no impurity or pollution associated with menstruation. Practices such as seclusion or staying away from school 
must be discouraged.
Staying clean during menstruation
Commonly women use a cloth which is folded and placed within the 
underwear, or passes over the private parts by means of a string tied around 
the waist. This cloth is washed and reused most of the time. A sanitary napkin 
is a pad worn within the underwear during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. Disposable sanitary napkins are more convenient and easier to use than 
reusable cloth. The blood is absorbed better and there is a feeling of dryness. 
When changed often, it can prevent infection and allows more mobility. It allows girls to take part in school activities."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,101,"101 Induction Training Module for ASHAs In some districts, government has launched a scheme to promote 
menstrual hygiene through distribution of Sanitary napkins.
If it is being implemented in your area you can obtain a stock of sanitary 
napkins from the ANM and store it for distribution to girls. Under this scheme, napkins are to be sold to the girls at a cost of Rs six per pack and for 
each pack sold you will get an incentive of Re 1.
1 The fund collected after the 
sale of the napkins needs to be returned to the ANM who will then provide you with more napkins (based on the demand) for further distribution.
Important facts related to menstrual hygiene
You should explain to adolescent girls:
l  Change the used napkin once it is wet. Wet napkin can cause irritation on the 
inside of the thighs and lead to infections.
l  Wash the body and private parts daily and during menstruation, the outer genitals should be washed from time-to-time to remove any blood that is 
left. Girls should wash their hands every time they change the napkin.
l  If the underwear is soiled, it must be changed. Otherwise this makes 
bacteria grow and cause infection.
l  Use a clean cloth pad if sanitary napkins are not available. Cloth should be changed three to four times a day in case of heavy periods and should be 
washed with hot water and soap and dried under the sun, stored in a clean 
dry place. 
l  Keep a track of their menstrual cycle so that they are prepared for the time when the bleeding starts. As periods can be irregular in the early years, they 
should be encouraged to be alert for the bleeding. If they are school going 
girls or plan to be out of home for a long time they should carry a sanitary napkin with them for changing.
l  To dispose sanitary napkins either by deep pit burial or by burning. In areas where waste disposal mechanisms are in place, it can be wrapped in a used 
newspaper and thrown in the community dust-bins.
Role of ASHA pertaining to menstrual hygiene
l  Organise monthly meetings on a fixed day with adolescent girls to provide 
health education on issues of menstruation and hygiene, sell and promote 
the use of sanitary napkins and communicate other adolescent health 
information. The venue of VHND and VHSNC can be used for this purpose.

 102Specific concerns of adolescent boys
The boys also may experience anxiety related to that adolescent changes. 
Some of these include:
l  Erection of Penis- In response to thoughts, fantasies, temperature, touch or 
sexual stimulation, the penis fills the blood and becomes hard and erect. 
In young adolescents erections may take place even in absence of sexual 
thoughts or stimulation and is a natural phenomenon.
l  Ejaculation- The release of semen from the penis is called ejaculation. This may occur at night and is commonly called a ‘wet dream’ . It is a natural and 
normal phenomenon- not a fault. 
Building the awareness of boys pertaining to the genital hygiene is useful. It is 
important to tell them that the genitals need to be washed daily as secretions 
accumulate under the foreskin of the penis and can cause infection if not 
cleaned regularly. They should wear dry, cotton undergarments which are washed and dried in the sun every day. 
Although you may not be consulted by boys directly, the information could be 
communicated to mothers of adolescent boys who seek your help for these concerns.
Nutritional anaemia
From our previous sections you know about Anaemia. Nutritional anaemia is common in adolescence and may be due to deficiency of Iron, Folic Acid, 
Vitamin C or Vitamin B 12 in the diet.
Adolescence and nutritional anaemia
Adolescence is a phase of rapid growth and development and the body needs 
extra iron for increased production of blood due to rapid increase in body mass. 
When this extra requirement of iron is unmet through proper diet and nutrition 
it leads to Nutritional Anaemia. It is more common in girls because of loss of blood through menstrual bleeding.
Anaemia has a serious negative impact on growth. Checking anaemia during 
this stage may help in correcting the deficits of childhood and lay down the foundations for better future health.
When girls enter reproductive age group with low iron stores there is an 
increased risk of anaemia in pregnancy- leading to low birth weight of the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,103,"103 Induction Training Module for ASHAs baby and with serious implications on maternal health. This also leads to a 
deficit of iron in early childhood which is carried on till adolescence and the 
cycle continues.
If anaemia is suspected it is important to refer the adolescent girl/boy to the 
nearest health facility for further examination. In case anaemia is established 
the adolescent will be given of IFA Tablets for few weeks or months till 
haemoglobin level improves.
ASHAs role in preventing nutritional anaemia
l  Counsel the adolescents and families and ensure compliance with IFA tablets as described in section on Ante natal care during pregnancy
l  Promote measures to control malaria and other parasitic infections like hookworm infestation by taking a six monthly dose of deworming tablet.
l  Promote hygienic measures like hand washing to prevent infections like diarrhoea.
l  Mobilise girls to avail services such as WIFS* at the Anganwadi Centre.
l  Bring about early Identification and Referral
*Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation 
Programme
This is a government run programme to address nutritional anaemia 
in adolescents. It includes the following target groups-
l School going Adolescent girls and boys in government/government aided/municipal schools from classes 6th -12th
l Out of school adolescent girls in the age group of 10-19 years.
Under this programme, IFA supplements are distributed free on 
a fixed day of the week to the target groups. In addition to IFA 
supplements, Albendazole tablets for deworming are administered twice a year. The school based distribution is done through nodal 
teachers and AWWs will provide these supplements to the out of 
school adolescent girls."

 104Behavioural changes
As a part of growing up many behavioural changes are noticed 
during adolescence. This may make them more prone to 
confrontations with the parents and others. You may notice 
some adolescents being aggressive while others may be shy. Some may experience complete lack of confidence while some 
display attention seeking behaviour. Different changes are 
manifested in different individuals. You need to understand that problems in this age are related not only to the physical 
changes but also to emotional development, a search for 
identity and risk taking behaviour. These changes should not be ignored. Such problems if not recognised and managed 
timely may lead to serious consequences such as alcohol/drug abuse, juvenile delinquency etc. Family environment and peer influence are the two most important factors influencing the behaviour of the adolescence
Role of ASHA in addressing behavioural challenges
l  Build awareness and enable access to the Adolescent Friendly Health Services available in your area by letting parents and adolescents know that 
these centres have counsellors which interact with adolescents at the times of crisis or concern and help them in sorting a way out of their problems. 
l  Counsel parents to be sensitive to these changes and adopt a strategy of parental supervision with good rapport building to avoid and solve such 
issues. They need to recognise and address the signs of anxiety in their 
children.
Concepts of sexuality are laid during this phase and it is important that 
the adolescents have access to the correct and complete information 
related to this. This information is provided by the trained counsellors at 
the AFHS Centres based in the District Hospital/CHC. Failure to provide adolescents with appropriate and timely information represents a 
missed opportunity for reducing the incidence of unwanted pregnancy, 
sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS and their negative consequences. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,105,"105 Induction Training Module for ASHAs What are Reproductive Tract Infections
Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive organs 
that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, 
they are more common in women, because their body structure and functions 
make it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).Women are more vulnerable to these 
infections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. 
sexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk..
Why are these Diseases not Addressed? 
Women are usually shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers. There is a reluctance to seek medical 
treatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. 
The ‘decision-makers’ at home, 
like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman 
to be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems 
or infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal 
discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs.
Mode of Spread of RTI and STI
You need to know not all the reproductive tract infections are sexually 
transmitted but all the sexually transmitted infections are reproductive tract 
infections. Those which are sexually spread are commonly observed in cases 
when individuals indulge in casual sex usually with infected individuals or have sex with multiple partners.
In women these infections are due to:
l  Trauma during delivery
l  Use of unclean instruments during childbirth or during abortions
Reproductive Tract Infections and 
Sexually Transmitted InfectionsSection 12"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,106,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 106l  Lack of genital hygiene particularly during menstruation
l  Sometimes also due to gastro-intestinal infections
l  Having unprotected sex with infected partners
Mothers can pass sexually transmitted infections to babies during delivery.
Signs and Symptoms of RTI 
l  Abnormal vaginal discharge, which is discoloured (bloody-yellow, greenish 
or curdy) and foul smelling – Some discharge from vagina during inter-
menstrual period, and pregnancy is normal. 
l  Ulcers or sores over the external genitals 
l  Lower abdominal pain
l  Pain or bleeding during intercourse 
l  Painful swelling in the groin 
l  Burning pain on passing urine 
l  Itching around the genitals 
Consequences of STIs
l  Infertility in men and women
l  Babies to be born too early, too small or blind; and
l  Long lasting pain in lower abdomen, or even cancer
l  Death from severe infection or AIDS
It is important that you make the women understand that these signs and symptoms could manifest very late. It is best to be aware that a woman can 
be at risk for a STI if the husband has signs of STI, has more than one sexual partner or where they could engage in casual sex in long period of travel.
Prevention of RTIs and STIs
l  Safe Deliveries in hospitals only by skilled attendant
l  Safe abortions done at registered hospitals only
l  Maintenance of genital hygiene during menstruation
l  Avoiding unsafe sex by use of condoms "
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,107,"107 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Role of ASHA in Managing and Preventing RTI and STI
l  Counsel women at risk on preventive measures.
l  Counsel women with symptoms of RTI/STI to go to the health facility 
for treatment. All 24X7 PHCs or higher facilities are equipped and skilled 
to provide necessary care. Tell them that they should take the course of 
medicine fully (all courses are for a week or ten days).
l  You should motivate the woman to complete the course of medicines. Not completing the course of medicines makes the bacteria resistant and can 
cause a worse infection that does not respond to drugs the next time.
l  Ensure that the husband also gets treated.
l  Counsel a woman to abstain from sexual activity during the period of 
treatment.
l  If the husband is known to indulge in extra-marital relationships, counsel the woman to avoid having unprotected sex.
HIV and AIDS
Its important for you to know the following:
l  HIV is transmitted through: 
l having unprotected sex (sex without condom);
l receiving HIV infected blood or blood products; 
l using/sharing unsterilised needles or lancets; and
l from HIV infected mother to her baby.
l  It does not spread through any other mode such as kissing and 
touching, holding hands, mosquito bites, sharing clothes, or 
through saliva, nose fluids, tears.
l  Who is at higher risk: Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs), Injecting 
Drug Users (IDUs), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), migrant 
labourers, persons with multiple sexual partners, babies born to 
mothers who are HIV infected, and persons with other STIs.
l  Persons with HIV are at greater risk of getting Tuberculosis. Every 1 in 20 persons suffering from TB in India is also HIV infected.
l  HIV can be prevented by using condom during sexual intercourse (protected sex), using safe blood (when blood transfusions are 
necessary) from blood bank of government hospitals or recognised 
hospitals only, using sterilised needles/avoid sharing of needles, and by avoiding sex with multiple partners."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,108,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs
 108l  HIV testing and management facility is available in the District Hospital free 
of cost. Treatment services for AIDS are available in some district hospitals or 
in the main government hospital in the big cities.
l  You should encourage persons at high risk to go for HIV test. If women who 
are at high risk become pregnant, they must be motivated to gets tested, as 
timely treatment may prevent transmission of HIV from HIV infected mother 
to baby."
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,109,"109 Induction Training Module for ASHAs It is important for you to build awareness on delay in the age of marriage, 
delaying the birth of first child and ensure spacing between children for 
overall healthy survival of women. The main focus of this chapter is to help 
you counsel woman to adopt the right method of family planning. You should be able to provide information about where, when and how to access services 
for sterilisation, Intra Uterine contraceptive Device (IUCD), Condoms and Oral 
Contraceptive Pills. 
Women’s Need for Family Planning Differ 
Different women and couples have different needs for contraception. When you counsel a woman on family planning, you should keep in mind the following:
l  Marital status
l Unmarried: condoms or pills or emergency pills
l Newly married and wanting to delay the first child: condoms or pills
l  Just delivered (post-partum) or just had an abortion (post-abortal): condoms, pills, IUCD, injectables
l  Wanting to space children: condoms, pills, IUCD, injectables. (Currently not available in the public sector, but being used in the private sector)
l  Not wanting more children: Long acting (10 years) IUCD and sterilisation for the man or the woman.

 112Remember
In motivating individuals for adopting an appropriate family planning 
method, issues such as marital status, age, parity and overall health 
condition of the individuals should be considered first. Promotion of 
contraceptive use based only on the money as incentives offered by the government should be discouraged and individuals should be encouraged 
to choose the right method independent of the money offered as 
compensation for wage loss.The operation for the man (Vasectomy)
A vasectomy is a simple operation, with only a small puncture to block the 
tubes that carry the sperm. It takes only a few minutes to do. The operation 
does not change a man’s ability to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure. He 
still ejaculates semen but there are no sperm in the semen. The couple must be advised to use condoms or other contraceptives for 90 days following 
vasectomy.
The operation for the woman (Tubectomy)A tubal ligation is a slightly more difficult operation than a vasectomy, but it is 
still very safe. It takes about 30 minutes. A trained doctor makes a small cut in 
the woman’s abdomen, and then cuts or ties the tubes that carry the egg to the womb. The woman can have the operation within seven days of the start of the 
menstrual cycle, 24 hours after delivery, or six weeks after the delivery.
ImportantSterilisation and pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections 
and HIV infection. So for protection from STIs and HIV, a condom should be 
used during every sexual intercourse, if the woman is at risk of contracting them.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHA English,113,"113 Induction Training Module for ASHAs A Woman Seeks Abortion Because
l  She does not want more children and has not used a contraceptive method 
properly or the method failed.
l  A pregnancy can endanger her life.
l  She has no partner who will help support child.
l  She got pregnant after rape.
l  The child will be born with serious birth defects.
When a woman is faced with an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to get 
a safe abortion.
Legality: In India, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks and if done by a qualified 
practitioner. Up to 12 weeks, one doctor can do it. After 12 weeks, two doctors 
need to sign the consent form. Abortion services are free in all government 
hospitals. Women over 18 do not need anyone else to sign a consent form.
Safety: In India, only a doctor can perform an abortion, and this should be done 
under clean conditions, and with proper instruments.
Safe abortion services are often difficult to get because, there are not enough 
service providers and facilities. Those providers who do provide abortion 
services may charge a lot of money or not even be legal providers of safe 
abortion services.
Methods
All these methods can only be done by a trained, legal provider
l  Medical Abortion: This can be done only in very early pregnancies less than seven weeks or 49 days after last missed period. The drugs 
should be prescribed by and taken under the supervision of a  
legal provider.

pregnancy.
l  Dilatation and curettage (D and C): This 
method can be done up to 12 weeks of 
pregnancy. It is associated with a higher risk 
of complications.
Post-Abortion Care
You should advise women
l  To avoid sexual intercourse or putting anything in the vagina for at least five days after the abortion.
l  Drink plenty of fluids for faster recovery.
l  That some bleeding from vagina for up to two weeks is normal, but it should be light. Next monthly period will be after 4-6 weeks.
l  That the risk of pregnancy exists as soon as intercourse is resumed regardless of monthly period. Therefore a contraceptive should be used.
Warning signs after abortion, for which you should advise 
immediate referral
l  Heavy bleeding
l  High fever
l  Severe pain in the abdomen
l  Fainting and confusion
l  Foul smelling discharge from the vagina.
Tasks for you to be involved in are
l  Counselling women who want abortion service or need more information 
to take a decision. Find out the nearest legal and safe public and private 
providers of such care.
l  Visit the mother at home on Days 3 and 7 after the abortion.

technique
A strong preference for a male child in our society often compels married 
couples to bear more children, till they have a boy. In cases where they 
already have female children, couples may indulge in practices like pre-
natal sex determination of the foetus, followed by an abortion, in case it is a female foetus. You must build awareness in the community that prenatal 
sex determination is a criminal offence and any individual found guilty for 
disclosing or seeking information about the sex of the foetus is punishable by court under the act of PCPNDT."

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,123,"123 Induction Training Module for ASHAsThis is the true story of how women from Dubagunta in Nellore district Andhra 
Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. 
The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women, predominantly 
from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties. It is about a miracle that ordinary 
women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a community of hard-working 
women who laboured in the fields to earn their living. The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the 
hard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), in 
exchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, they incurred debts or stole household articles like glasses, plates or even their wives’ saris. After 
drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making 
their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to go straight to these shops in the evening 
after returning from work. They came home late at night, completely drunk They 
would hand over some money for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his 
father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community 
also had an alcoholic husband, when her relatives visited her house they were scared away from the village by the obscene language of her closest neighbour, 
a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed and thought that the village would be a much 
better place without arrack.
Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women 
discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached 
the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders. They expressed their problem and asked them to get remove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the 
Sarpanch, although agreeable, were unable to do anything. The next day one 
hundred women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come into the village’ , they told the cart driver 
strongly in unison and stood in front of it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them 
offered him a rupee to do so. The driver got scared and left the village.
Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded 
that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police came to the 
village and said that all those who bid at auctions had the right to sell arrack. The women stood unmoved. They said that they would go to the Collector and would 
not keep quiet if arrack was sold in their village. The arrack contractors got cold feet.  Annexure 4: Anti Arrack Movement"

 124They made several plans, but nothing worked and they gave up. These events gave 
strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and 
struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from their village.
The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the 
district.
In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community 
through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village, with the result that women in other villages did the 
same.
The women in Dubagunta started a movement in which ultimately the situation 
changed for the better.
In 1991 was the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor) Movement, which finally 
led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on 16 January 1995.

I am working as ASHA for the village________of________Block. My village has 
a population of________. The houses are scattered across the areas. The ANM 
regularly comes and organises VHND. However, it is organised at a place which is not 
accessible for all the pregnant women. A large number of women living on the other 
side of the village, are not able to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. 
I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the village 
on different dates. I had a discussion about the same with the ANM. She informed 
me that she needs permission from you. I request you to look into this matter. As an 
ASHA I take the responsibility to bring all the pregnant women so they have their 
antenatal check-up. You are welcome to visit our village. 
Thank you.

l Fill the bottom 1/3 depth loose stones and brickbats, and fill the next 1/3 of the with 
smaller half size brickbats. 
l Fill the top third of the pit with even smaller brickbats. To stop rain water from 
entering the pit raise its borders by 10 centimetres above the ground level. 
l Fill it with dry grass or coconut coir on top. 
l Putting a used earthen pot at top with hole in bottom helps in straining water. 
l Connect the wastewater into this pot by using a pipe. Cover entire area with coir. The 
coir works like a filter. Clean or change the coir every month.

Induction Training Module for ASHA English,133,"133 Induction Training Module for ASHAsAnnexure 10: Home Based Remedies for Common 
Illnesses
Neem
Parts used are- leaves, fruits and outer portion of the stem. Leaves are used for 
skin diseases like eczema, infection. The oil and decoction of crushed neem 
leaves, is useful in itching and wound healing as it is a great antiseptic. Also 
used as pest-control medicine. 
Making neem oil: make 100 ml fresh juice of neem leaves. Add 25 cc sesame 
oil to this. Slow boil the mixture under cover. The water part will completely 
evaporate in half an hour. Cool and filter it. This is neem oil for wound care. Keep it in a well-capped bottle. It will stay for one year. Apply this to wounds 2-3 
times a day. This heals the wound well. For childbirth injuries, neem water bath 
is a healing treatment. Crush some leaves of neem and put them in warm bath 
water. Let the mother sit for fifteen minutes in this bathtub.
Tulsi
Tulsi leaves are useful in cough and cold. Give the tulsi juice with honey. The 
leaves are hot in nature that is why they are used in kafadosha. The decoction of Tulsi leaves is also useful for cough. The leaves are chewable. The seeds of tulsi 
are cold in nature. Hence the seeds are used in heat (pitta) disorders like heart 
burn, bleeding from nose, Burning feet, bleeding piles, sore mouth etc. Give the seeds with milk or ghee. Soak 20-30 seed grains in water or milk. This is a dose 
for once. Take it 2-3 times a day. Take about a cupful of tulsi leaves. Soak them 
in water for five minutes. Then crush them on a stone. Strain in cloth and collect about 20 ml juice (half a cup). Crush more leave if necessary to make 20 ml. This 
makes 3 doses for one day for an adult. This is good for cold and fever illnesses. 
Give it for 3 days. For children the dose could be 10 leaves juice, 2-3 times a day.
Kumari
Kumari (Aloe) is a garden plant. In wounds, we can apply aloe in place of a medicated dressing. Take a piece of aloe about the size of the wound. Cut it into 
a slice. Clean the wound with water. Apply the aloe slice on it and tie up with 
a clean cloth bandage. Change the dressing every day. It heals faster. It is very useful for burns treatment as dressings. Kumari is used in several Ayurvedic 
preparations. It is useful for liver disorders and women’s illnesses like pain in 
the periods. It is also used for dandruff and for the growth of hair. You can grow kumari in your garden and ask people to grow in the kitchen garden. It is hardy 
plant and stays for years.

tree-stem is used for medicine. This is a good medicine for loose motions and 
dysentery. You can simply grind a piece of bark and mix with a spoon of honey and give as medicine. Kadha (Kawatha) also is useful. For this take a 10 gm (2 
teaspoon full) of bark powder, add one glass (200 ml) of water and boil. Boil it till 
¼ water remains. Cool and bottle it. For an adult 20 ml kadha (Kawatha) for  3 times a day is useful to stop dysentry.

Introduction to Elderly Care
Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres are bringing healthcare services closer to the community 
and at the same time providing comprehensive healthcare to the people. Along with maternal, child and 
adolescent health services, an expanded range of service packages are being introduced through the AB-
HWCs. Elderly care is an important package among these expanded services.
With improving healthcare quality, increased access to healthcare services and greater awareness 
among the population, people all over the world are now living longer than before. It has therefore 
become important to ensure a healthy ageing process along with continued wellness through old age. 
Simultaneously it is also important to understand health needs of elderly and facilitate care seeking for 
them. Providing support to the caregivers of the elderly, especially to those who have bed ridden elderly 
to cater to, is equally essential. The focus is mainly on facilitating access of health services for the elderly, 
psychosocial support for the elderly and their family, nutritional care and home-based care for bed ridden 
elderly.
As an ASHA, you are part of Health and Wellness Centre team and closest to the community, you would 
play a major role in identifying the elderly in need and facilitating health care access for them. You would 
also be a key member for promoting healthy ageing, ensuring right nutrition and providing psychosocial 
support. 
This module will act as a guide to help you identify various common elderly health conditions and 
determine what to do in these situations. By the end of this module, you will learn:
•	 To	identify	elderly	in	need	of	care	in	the	community	 and	facilitate	their	access	to	health	care
•	 To	conduct	home	visits	for	elderly	supported	and	supplemented	by	MPW(F/M)
•	 To	 carry	out	health	promotion	 and	IEC	activities	 regarding	 elderly	care	on	community	
platforms 
•	 To	identify	signs	and	symptoms	for	common	health	problems	affecting	elderly
•	 To	identify	caregivers	 within	or	outside	the	family	and	link	them	to	the	nearest	health	care	
facility."
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,2,
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,3,"3
As	per	Ministry	of	Health	&	Family	Welfare,	citizens	above	the	age	of	60	years	are	considered	 to	be	
elderly. With socio-economic development, declining fertility and increase in survival at older ages, the 
proportion	 of	older	people	(60	years	and	above)	in	general	population	 has	increased	 substantially	 within	
a relatively short period of time.
India recorded a significant improvement in life expectancy at birth, which was 47 years in 1969, growing 
to	60	years	in	1994	and	69	years	in	2019.The	 share	of	population	 of	elderly	was	8%	in	2015	i.e.	106	
million	(10	crores	plus)	across	the	nation,	making	India	the	second	largest	global	population	 of	elderly	
citizens.	Further,	it	has	been	projected	 that	by	2050	the	elderly	population	 will	increase	to	19%.	Therefore,	
to identify the health needs of the elderly, it is necessary to understand ageing and age-related changes. 
So, first we will understand the process of ageing
What is ageing?
Ageing is a universal phenomenon comprising of gradual loss of cells leading to deterioration of organ 
functions in a human body. Age related alteration affects across the elderly population and their body 
function diminishes.
Age-related changes in human body system
It is important for a caregiver to understand the age-related changes in the human body which will further 
help in meeting their needs. 
What are the signs of ageing?
 Vision impairment 
 Hearing impairment
 Disturbed sleep
 Loss of teeth
 Change in taste
 Decline in functions of lungs
 Decline in functions of heart
 Decline in functions of kidneyAgeing is not a disease but the elderly population are more susceptible to various diseases due to 
decreased immune response and poor regenerating capacity.

Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,4,"4
 Wrinkling of skin
 Decrease in muscle strength
 Decrease inbone strength 
 Loss of bladder control
 Loss of appetite
 Decrease in sexual function
 Decrease in memory
 Increase in tiredness
Health risks in older patients
Various risk factors and their ill effects in elderly people have been identified. They are listed in the 
following table.
No. Health risks in elderly Consequences
1Nutritional deficiencies (over or 
under nutrition)Decreased bone mass, immune dysfunction
2Inadequate consumption of fibre 
and fruitsConstipation 
3Physical inactivity and sedentary 
lifestyleFunctional decline, loss of appetite
4Smoking Diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and lung diseases
5Excessive alcohol consumption Decreased rate of metabolism, liver diseases, cancer
6Drug reaction and polypharmacy Decreased physical functioning, falls, delirium, renal failure, 
gastrointestinal and intracranial bleeding 
7Accidents and injuries Infections, complications, decreased physical functioning
How do you assess the risk in elderly?
Completion of Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) is required for all elderly in the SHC-
HWC area. This will be done for each village by ASHA. The section B3 is specific to elderly.
B3: Elderly-specific 	(60	years	and	
above)Y/N Y/N
Do you feel unsteady while standing 
or walking?Do you need help from others to 
perform everyday activities such as 
eating, getting dressed, grooming, 
bathing, walking, or using the toilet?
Are you suffering from any physical 
disability that restricts your movement?Do you forget names of your near ones 
or your own home address?"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,5,"5
ASHA  will identify all elderly in need of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment-CPHC if the answer to 
any of the questions in Part B3 of CBAC 	is	‘Yes’	and	will	refer	to		MPW	(F/M)	for	further	assessment	
Responses will be elicited from the elderly if the person is oriented; otherwise, responses will be taken 
from the first care giver.
The Operational Guidelines of Elderly care at Health and Wellness Centers envisage mobility-based 
classification of elderly with three main categories-
1.	 Mobile	elderly
2.	 Restricted	mobile	elderly	(mobility	only	with	personal	assistance	/device)	and
3.	 Bed-bound	 (assistance	 required	in	some	form)/home	 bound	elderly	for	any	reason	and	those	
requiring palliative care or end of life care
Assessment	 of	highrisk	of	elderly	is	conducted	 based	on	mobility.	Services	prioritized	 in	the	order	of	bed	
bound elderly, restricted mobile elderly and mobile elderly.
How would you elicit the age of elderly who do not remember their age? It can be guessed by 
asking about
•	 age	of	the	eldest	child	or	grandchild
•	 historical/political	events"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,6,"6
As people grow old, there are some degenerative conditions that occur. Elderly people are also prone to 
some diseases. In this chapter, you will learn about a few common health problems in the elderly.
Common	 conditions	 in	older	age	include	hearing	loss,	blurred	vision/	difficulty	in	reading,	back	and	neck	
pain, diabetes, depression, and dementia. Furthermore, as people age, they are more likely to experience 
several conditions at the same time. 
1. Eye problems:
•	 Elderly	 people	often	start	having	issues	with	their	eyesight	as	their	age	progresses.	 However,	
it is not necessary that every elderly would have weakened eyesight.
•	 It	needs	to	be	kept	in	mind	that	elderly	with	diabetes	may	be	at	the	risk	of	developing	
weakened eyesight. 
•	 Eyesight	for	near	vision	improves	and	distance	vision	weakens
•	 Blurred/weakened	 vision	can	limit	mobility	of	elderly,	affect	interpersonal	 interactions.	 It	may	
be a trigger for depression. It often becomes a barrier to accessing information, increases the 
risk of falls and accidents, and makes driving dangerous.
•	 Uncontrolled	diabetes	and	increased	blood	pressure	can	lead	to	issues	related	to	eyesight.
Let’s	learn	about	common	eye	problems	in	elderly.
 a) Difficulty in seeing the objects nearby: Presbyopia
•	 This	is	a	common	complaint	among	elderly.	
•	 It	is	a	condition	that	is	age	related	and	is	commonly	starts	after	the	age	of	40.	
•	 In	presbyopia,	 the	person	is	not	able	to	view	near	objects	properly	and	finds	difficulty	in	
reading.
•	 It	can	be	easily	corrected	by	use	of	spectacles.	
•	 There	are	ready	made	spectacles	available	which	provide	correction	for	near	vision.	.		
 b) Cataract:
•	 Cataract	 is	the	most	common	 eye	problem	in	the	
elderly.
•	 It	is	a	leading	cause	of	blindness	 across	the	world	
and India as well. 
•	 Cataract	usually	causes	gradual	loss	of	sight.	
•	 The	pupil;	black	circle	of	eye	shows	chalky	white	or	
Common Illnesses in 
ElderlyChapter

Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,7,"7
greenish-grey colour.
•	 It	needs	a	small	surgery	where	the	damaged	 part	(lens)	is	removed	and	replaced	with	new	
artificial lens. 
•	 No	other	treatment	like	eye	drops/	spectacles	can	cure	this	condition.	
2. Issues with hearing:
•	 As	a	part	of	ageing,	people	may	start	gradually	losing	their	hearing.	
•	 Many	 of	the	elderly	could	complain	 about	not	being	able	to	hear	clearly	and	ask	the	other	
person to speak loudly. 
•	 This	 condition	 could	also	bring	a	lot	of	irritation	to	the	elderly	as	well	as	others	around	them.
•	 Untreated	 hearing	loss	affects	communication	 and	thus	may	also	contribute	 to	social	isolation	
and loss of autonomy. 
•	 Inability	to	hear	properly	is	often	associated	with	anxiety,	depression.	
•	 This	 may	not	be	understood	 quickly	by	the	family	members	 and	also	could	be	seen	as	elderly	
person	“being	slow”.	
Role of ASHA for addressing Loss of Hearing and Vision:
1.	 Fill	 out	the	assessment	 of	difficulty	in	hearing/	 seeing/	reading	in	the	Community	 Based	
Assessment Checklist. 
2. Reassure them about sensory loss being normal with ageing. 
3.	 Mobilise	 the	elderly	to	visit	the	nearby	health	and	wellness	centre	along	with	the	family	
members for screening  and further management. 
Key message regarding Cataract: 
1. Cataract is normally seen in elderly people and can be a result of ageing. 
2. It cannot be cured by putting some eye drops but will require eye surgery. 
3. The surgery commonly involves taking out the affected lens from the eye and replacing it 
with a new lens so that vision can be restored normal. 
4. The procedure is done under local anaesthesia so that eye surgery can be done. 
5.	 The	 surgery	is	safe	and	commonly	 done.	It	should	be	done	in	a	recognized	 hospital	and	NOT	
in the community or PHC.  
6.	 Under	 National	Programme	 for	Prevention	 and	Control	of	Blindness	 and	Visual	Impairment,	
Government eye hospitals provide free surgeries to affected persons.
7. Both eyes may get affected due to ageing. The surgery may be required in both the eyes. "
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,8,"8
Role of ASHA in addressing Falls :
1. Advise family members for support to the elderly while carrying out routine activities
2.	 Mobilise	 the	elderly	and	family	members	 to	the	nearby	Health	and	Wellness	 Centre	for	
appropriate care. 
3. Asess the risk of falls by ruling out environmental and individual-level factors and asking the 
elderly to stand up and walk to a nearby wall.
4. Complete B3 (according to the latest version of CBAC) section of the individual assessment 
5.	 Record	keeping	of	provision	of	assistive	devices	to	the	beneficiary.
6. Follow up for the fall injury, working of assistive devices and compliance with them.3. Falls and fractures:
•	 Elderly	people	are	often	at	risk	of	falling.
•	 Multiple	 factors	like	difficulties	 with	vision,	balance	and	mobility,	 slippery	flooring,	dim	
lighting, obstacles, poor stairway design, uneven streets and footpaths, improper use of 
assistive devices, inappropriate footwear may put elderly individuals at increased risk of falls. 
•	 Falling	 may	cause	fractures	of	bone	easily	for	the	elderly	since	bones	grow	weaker	with	ageing.
•	 Caregivers	 should	be	advised	to	accompany	 elderly	while	walking,	going	for	bathing,	toilet	etc.
•	 They	should	also	be	informed	about	assistive	devices	like	walking	stick,	walker	etc.	
•	 The	 family	should	also	be	facilitated	 for	getting	assistive	devices	through	the	health	and	
wellness centre. 
•	 If	there	is	any	recent	fall	that	has	caused	a	wound	or	a	bruise,	you	should	notify	the	CHO.	
You	should	also	help	the	MPW(F)	in	nursing	of	the	wound	if	any.	
•	 Falls	are	multifactorial.	This	may	be	due	to	individual-level	and	environmental	factors	
•	 Environmental	factors	include:
 Slippery bathroom
	 Unsafe	floor/staircase
 Poor lighting
	 Unsafe	kitchen
	 Inappropriate	use	of	walkers	&	crutches
•	 Individual-level	factors	include:
 Acute illness
 lower limb muscle weakness
	 Medications	like	sedatives	etc
 Foot problems
 problems in vision and hearing. 
"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,9,"9
4. Genitourinary problems
•	 Most	of	the	elderly	suffer	from	genitourinary	problems.	
•	 In	case	of	men,	genitourinary	 problems	 are	commonly	 due	to	enlargement	 of	the	prostate	
gland in old age and in women it is mainly due to weak muscles.
•	 This	 leads	to	symptoms	 like	frequent	and	urgent	need	to	urinate,	difficulty	in	starting	urination,	
weak urine stream, dribbling of urine and inability to completely empty the bladder.
•	 This	 may	cause	significant	 distress	to	them.	These	individuals	 must	be	referred	to	the	Medical	
Officer for treatment.
5. Psychological problems
As age advances in, elderly their routine is disturbed and may experience the following psychological 
problems: 
•	 Forgetfulness
•	 Dementia	(loss	of	memory)
•	 Depression	
•	 Age	related	memory	loss
•	 Sleep	disturbances
•	 Mood	swings	etc
ASHA should notify CHO if any of the following signs and symptoms are observed or if informed 
by the first care giver:
 Withdrawal from social activities
	 Lack/	excessive	sleep
 Feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness
 Loss of interest in pleasurable things
 Loss of interest in food intake
 Increased confusion
 Neglecting personal care (grooming, bathing, clothing)
 Frequent incidents of irritation and agitation leading to anger outburst. 
Activities to assess memory problems in elderly:
 Recall of day, date and time 
 Food recall
 Practise button up shirt, calculation of money and coins in purse
 Encourage elderly to dress up self 
 If literate, they may also be engaged in grocery calculation"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,10,"10
Role of ASHA in addressing psychological problems in elderly:
1. Form elderly support groups where elderly would get to interact with their peers.
2. Conduct wellness activities for the support groups or encouraging them for conducting 
wellness activities themselves.
3. Communicate with the elderly about how they feel and how they have been for the past few 
days during the home visits. 
5.	 Completethe	 individual	 assessment	 (Part	D:	PHQ2).	*If	the	total	score	is	more	than	3,	CHO	
should be informed.
Role of ASHA in addressing Oral health in elderly:
1. Encourage regular oral check-ups by self-examination
2. Check for any signs and symptoms mentioned above and notify CHOMajority of elderly groups suffer from poor oral health issues
1. Elderly often practice traditional methods of cleaning of teeth which may be inadequate to 
maintain oral hygiene.
2. Diseases of other parts of the body may also lead to increased risk of oral disease.
3. Adverse side effects of some treatment may also lead to dry mouth, altered sense of taste and 
smell.
4. Poor oral health results in impaired nutritional status and general health, reduced self-esteem, 
wellbeing and quality of life
5.	 ASHA	 should	notify	CHO	if	any	of	the	following	 signs	and	symptoms	 are	observed	 or	as	
informed by the first care giver:
•	 Dry	mouth
•	 Tooth	pain
•	 Tooth	infection
•	 Discoloration	of	tooth
•	 Swelling/infection	of	gums
•	 Bleeding	of	gums
•	 Inability	to	open	mouth6. Oral Health Problems"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,11,"11
7. Hypertension
•	 High	 Blood	Pressure,	 also	known	as	‘silent	killer’	remains	silent	and	undetected	 unless	
specifically checked among the elderly.
•	 Normal	range	of	Blood	Pressure	among	the	elderly	is	140/90	mm	of	Hg.
•	 If	undetected,	high	blood	pressure	may	damage	the	heart,	brain,	kidneys	and	blood	vessels
ASHA should notify CHO if any of the following signs and symptoms are observed or if informed 
by the first care giver:
 Complaints of headache
 Increased attacks of sweating, headache and palpitations
 Breathlessness
 Bleeding from nose
Role of ASHA in addressing high blood pressure in elderly
1. Ensure that elderly undergo monthly monitoring of blood pressure
2.	 Motivate	elderly	in	compliance	to	treatment	plan	for	drugs
3. Advise for regular check up as advised at the AB-HWC
4. Advise for regular physical activity
8. Diabetes
•	 Similar	 to	hypertension,	 diabetes	is	also	termed	as	‘silent	killer’	which	gets	detected	only	
when it is specifically checked.
•	 Diabetes	can	also	lead	to	complications	like	heart	attack	or	stroke
ASHA should notify CHO if any of the following signs and symptoms are observed or as informed 
by the first care giver:
 Frequent urination 
 Increased hunger
 Excessive thirst
	 Unexplained	weight	loss
 Lack of energy
 Extreme tiredness
 Lack of interest

	 Musculoskeletal	 disorders	 are	injuries	or	disorders	 of	muscles,	nerves,	joints,	tendons,	cartilages	
and spinal discs impairing the movement.  
•	 Accounts	for	increased	morbidity	among	the	elderly	population
•	 Timely	recognition	may	prevent	complications	including	falls	and	deformities
 ASHA should notify CHO if any of the following signs and symptoms are observed or as informed 
by the first care giver:
 Joint Pain
	 Difficulty	in	walking/squatting
 Swelling in joints
 Neck pain
 Back acheRole of ASHA in addressing Diabetes in elderly:
1.	 Follow-up	 of	the	patients	referred	to	the	health	facilities/referral	 centres	andsupport	 them	
through the consultation and diagnostic processes as required.
2. Compliance to treatment plan for drugs as advised by the medical doctor.
3. Be alert to new signs and symptoms - they may be due to side-effects of themedicines being 
taken.
4. Ensure regular check-up at the AB-HWC as advised.
5.	 Ensure	 that	the	patient	and	their	family	members	 receive	education	 on	diabetes	management	
and lifestyle modifications.
6. Conduct regular home-visits by prioritising those households which are vulnerable and 
marginalised, where there are treatment defaulters or those who experience complications 
and	bring	these	cases	to	the	notice	of	the	MPW	(F/M),	CHO	and	the	Medical	Officer."
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,13,"13
As ASHA, you are the key to raise awareness in your community about the health needs of elderly, 
promote	 healthy	lifestyle,	recognize	 signs	and	symptoms	 for	common	 health	problems	 affecting	 the	
elderly, facilitate referral to AB-HWC and follow up.
You	will	also	need	to	provide	information	 to	the	community	 members	 during	home	visits	and	in	VHSNC/
MAS	meetings,	 with	special	attention	 on	families	having	elderly	people,	regarding	 promotive,	 preventive	
and rehabilitative care of the elderly. This is to facilitate environmental modification, nutritional intervention 
and physical activities including yoga, lifestyle and behavioral changes in favor of healthy ageing.
This chapter is divided into two:
Part A: Health Promotion and Counselling
Part B: Self Care
Part A: Health Promotion and Counselling
What is Health Promotion?
Health Promotion focusses on
•	 Keeping	people	healthy.
•	 Helping	people	make	changes	in	lifestyle	to	prevent	diseases
•	 Motivating	behavior	change	to	avoid	complications	with	diseases
Things to keep in mind while interacting with elderly:
1.	 Be	 patient	with	them!	Understand	 that	they	might	have	lost	some	of	their	ability	to	hear	or	see.	
Raise	your	voice	accordingly	but	don’t	shout	at	them.
2. They might not accept your suggestions immediately. Pursue them slowly for seeking care. Try to 
pursue the family members and caregivers as well. 
3. Encourage them for doing mild physical activity wherever feasible. 
4. Respect their autonomy. Ask them whether they need assistance. They might not like to be assumed 
as weak individuals. 
5.	 Be	gentle	with	them	while	helping	them	around.	
Counselling an elderly person
 Providing counselling for older persons helps them to deal with the problems of old 
age, and can also provide the opportunity for enrichment, personal growth, and 
satisfaction. Health Promotion, Self-Care, 
and Counselling for Elderly CareChapter
3"
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,14,"14
 Good counselling approaches build upon a foundation of respect, empathy, and 
support. A high degree of sensitivity, awareness, and acceptance among health care 
workers is required for giving care and counselling to elderly.
  Counselling the elderly should address issues of anxiety and stress, related to the losses 
of their life, particularly the sense of losing control over one`s life. It should also help 
them in understanding and accepting the value and reality of their life, help in decision 
making	and	increasing	autonomy	as	well	as	deal	with	depression	and	demoralization.
The objectives of elderly counselling 
•	 To	understand	the	psycho-social	and	biological	problems	of	old	people.	
•	 To	help	them	to	solve	their	problems.	
•	 To	enhance	wellness	in	their	life.
Key messages for community regarding elderly care:
•	 Elderly	individuals	have	different	health	needs.	They	need	to	be	looked	after	with	care.	
•	 They	 commonly	 face	loss	of	sensory	functions,	 commonly	 sight	and	hearing.	One	needs	to	keep	it	
in mind while interacting with them. 
•	 Everyone	 in	the	community	 should	be	responsible	 towards	the	elderly.	As	a	community	 we	should	
support and help them around if they need any help.
•	 If	you	come	across	any	destitute	or	single	elderly,	you	should	enquire	about	them,	their	health	and	
whether	they	require	any	support.	You	should	also	notify	the	ASHA/MPW	about	them.
•	 Speak	 to	ASHA	if	you	need	any	support	in	helping	or	taking	care	of	elderly	in	your	household.	 She	
will be able to help you and also connect you to the health and wellness centre. 
•	 Elderly	 abuse	could	happen	around	you	but	may	stay	hidden.	If	you	suspect	elderly	abuse	happening	
with any individual, within or outside your house, you should immediately report it to the ASHA of 
the village or to the health and wellness centre. 
•	 You	should	take	initiative	in	preventing	elderly	abuse	around	you.	
Key messages for families with elderly individuals:
•	 Be	 patient	with	them!	Family	members	 should	understand	 that	elderly	need	to	be	cared	with	
patience and compassion. 
•	 Elderly	 may	also	feel	isolated	because	of	reduced	hearing	and	vision.	Family	members	 should	try	
and make them feel included in the family functions. 
•	 Speak	 to	ASHA	if	you	need	any	support	in	helping	or	taking	care	of	elderly	in	your	house.	She	will	
be able to help you and also connect you to the health and wellness centre. 
•	 You	 might	not	be	skilled	at	nursing	needs	of	the	elderly	(in	case	of	bed	bound	or	restricted	 elderly).	
If	there	is	any	nursing	task	like	wound	care/	catheterization/	 changing	 diapers,	contact	the	ASHA	
of	the	village.	She	will	connect	the	MPW	F/M	and	Health	and	wellness	centre	team	to	your	
household. They will also train you regarding these tasks. "
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,15,"15
•	 Elderly	 individuals	 may	have	many	health	concerns	 at	the	same	time.	Most	of	them	could	be	
because of ageing. You should accompany them to the health and wellness centre for check-ups. 
•	 In	case	the	elderly	is	restricted,	 or	bed	bound,	notify	the	ASHA	about	health	concerns.	 She	will	
connect the health and wellness team for home visits. 
•	 Elderly	 are	at	higher	risk	for	falls	and	since	their	bones	are	weak	even	slight	injury	may	result	in	
fracture. Family members need to take care that there are no wet floors, slippery stairs in the house. 
Elderly should be having proper footwear. They should be accompanied whenever possible. 
•	 Support	 groups	for	elderly	are	created	by	ASHA	of	the	village.	They	will	help	you	with	interacting	
with others who also have elderly in their house. These groups will help you regarding taking 
care of elderly. Such sharing helps with the stress that may come from having to take care of a 
dependent person. Do join these groups and be a supporter for others as well!
•	 It	could	be	often	exhausting	for	one	person	to	take	care	of	the	elderly	constantly.	Family	members	
are suggested to take turns to take care of the elderly.

Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,22,"22
Elderly individuals require special care and support. The Primary Health Care Team has the responsibility 
for providing care for the elderly starting from the community level to the SHC-HWC and PHC-HWC 
level.
At the community level: 	ASHA,	MPW(M/F)	 will	identify	elderly	individuals	 in	the	community,	 undertake	
risk assessment of the elderly, provide counseling and support to the elderly for various health conditions, 
provide support to the caregivers, enable formation of support groups for the elderly and caregivers, 
identify and medical conditions and refer to the CHO for further management and provide follow up care.
At the SHC-HWC level: 	CHO	will	manage	common	geriatric	ailments	and/or	refer	to	appropriate	 higher	
centers,	arrange	for	suitable	supportive	 devices	from	higher	centres	to	the	elderly	/disabled	 persons	to	
make them ambulatory, provide counselling and support to elderly and their caregivers.
At the referral centre level:  Diagnosis and treatment of complicated conditions, surgical care, rehabilitation 
and	counselling	will	be	provided	for	the	elderly	by	Medical	Officer	or	specialists.
Key Tasks of ASHA in elderly care:
1. Community level
•	 Identifying	and	listing	the	elderly	in	the	village
•	 Awareness	generation
2. As Continuum of care
•	 Carrying	out	household	visits
•	 Risk	assessment
•	 Notification	to	the	CHO	
•	 Home	based	follow	up	visits	Service Delivery

Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,23,"23
Key tasks of ASHAs for elderly care:  
At Community level
1. Identifying and listing the elderly in the village:
As an ASHA, one of your activities is to undertake line listing of households in your village 
and are therefore aware about how many elderly individuals are there in the village. For elderly 
care, it is necessary to know how many elderly persons currently bed-bound, restricted 
and mobile . Thus, the identification and listing is an important task. This will also help you to 
know	which	household	 to	visit	while	following	 up.	Mobile	elderly	and	their	caregiver	 should	be	
encouraged to visit health and wellness centres for care seeking. They should also be informed 
about screening and health camps and mobilised to attend them.
In addition to this, you would identify destitute elderly, elderly poor and single elderly  in 
your area and list them. These individuals may require special care. They should also be visited 
from time to time and provided with psychosocial support. This will also help to establish a 
communication between the primary health care team and the identified elderly.
2. Awareness generation: 
One of your key functions would be to create awareness in the community regarding various aspects 
of	elderly	care.	You	can	utilise	community	 platforms	 like	VHSNC/MAS	 to	create	awareness	 about	
healthy	ageing.	Apart	from	sensitizing	 the	community	 towards	the	various	needs	of	the	elderly,	
you will also address issues like ways to reduce risk of falls in the elderly, malnutrition in elderly 
individuals and neglect of care in elderly through advice for geriatric friendly home settings. You 
can	also	sensitize	caregivers	 to	identify	common	 problems	 among	the	elderly	and	orient	them	to	
home-based care. Youcan also raise awareness regarding the National Programme for Health Care 
of Elderly and the provisions under the programme. 
a.	 You	 will	assist	the	Primary	Health	Care	team	in	organizing	 health	education	 camps	to	address	
basic issues like personal hygiene maintenance, nutritional counseling and explaining the 
associated risks to the caregiver. These camps can also serve as platforms to create awareness 
regarding	 modifications	 within	the	physical	home	environment	 to	help	reduce	hazards	that	
cause falls and fractures in the elderly. 
b.	 You	 will	also	utilize	home	visits	to	undertake	 individual	 and	family	counseling	 in	households	
with bed-bound elderly individuals including counseling for the caregivers.
3. Mobilization of Elderly Support groups ‘Sanjeevini’: 
Similar to the NCD support groups, Elderly support groups and Elderly Caregiver support groups 
may also be created to facilitate the goal of achieving healthy ageing in the population. The Elderly 
support groups will promote social inclusion and the Caregiver support groups would support 
each other in taking care of the elderly at home. As an ASHA you should try and get at least 2-3 
members to get together and tell about goals of the group. These group meetings should be kept "
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,24,"24
regular according to the members. Once the meetings start, more and more members are hoped 
to join as the word spreads.
Key tasks of ASHAs for elderly care: In continuum of care
1. Household visits:  During your home visits for filling CBAC form, you will be able to identify 
the	households	 where	elderly	individuals	 are	residing.	With	the	support	from	MPW(F/M),	 youcan	
undertake counselling of the elderly and their family members in healthy lifestyle, improved care 
seeking and increasing supportive environment in families and community.
2. Risk assessment: Completion of Community based assessment checklist (CBAC) is required for 
all the elderly. This is the same one that is carried out for the screening of NCDs. The section B3 
is specific to the elderly  which needs to be filled. You should keep in mind that if a person says 
“yes”	for	a	question,	 it	does	not	necessarily	 mean	that	they	have	the	disease.	Similarly,	 if	a	person	
says	“no”	for	a	question,	 it	does	not	mean	that	they	do	not	have	the	disease.	You	need	to	build	
rapport and engage in conversation with the elderly individuals in order to obtain the necessary 
history for any health condition.
3. Notification to the CHO:  You should notify to the CHO according to the instructions in the 
individual assessment form, for increased risk, or if any disease, health condition, malnutrition or 
case	of	abuse	is	suspected.	MPW	(F/M)	will	support	you	for	such	notifications.	
4. Home based follow up visits:  Follow up for those who have been referred to the CHO or 
discharged from higher facilitiesis an important step to ensure continuum of care. In case patient 
presents with any complain during follow up, you must refer the patient to the nearby health and 
wellness	centre.	If	the	patient	is	bed	bound/	restricted	 the	CHO	needs	to	be	notified	for	home	visit.	
5.	Compliance to treatment:  For any elderly individual on medication, you must note whether 
there is compliance for the medication and treatment. 
6. Assistive devices: In case any elderly individual is prescribed or using any assistive devices or 
dentures or spectacles, you should ask if they are being used regularly. If there are not being used 
regularly, you should ask for the reasons of non-usage to the elderly and the caregiver. You should 
counsel such individuals about importance of regular use. In case the patient still does not continue 
the	use	of	devices,	you	will	notify	theMPW	(F/M)	and	CHO	for	further	assistance."
Elderly Care Training Manual for ASHA,25,"25
You should inform the caregivers about regular cleaning of spectacles, dentures and maintaining 
the devices in good state: 
Key points regarding maintenance:
a. Denture maintenance: 
•	 Denture	should	be	cleaned	regularly.
•	 One	can	use	clean	water,	soap	and	toothbrush	to	clean	the	denture.
•	 It	should	be	cleaned	gently	and	take	care	that	it	does	not	fall	and	break.	
•	 Denture	should	be	removed	in	the	night	and	kept	in	clean	water	overnight
•	 Dentures	should	be	kept	away	from	children’s	reach
b. Spectacle maintenance:
•	 You	 should	not	touch	the	glasses	directly.	You	should	hold	them	by	the	side	or	by	the	
sticks.
•	 Lenses/	glasses	of	the	Spectacle	should	be	cleaned	by	a	soft,	clean	cloth.	
•	 Spectacles	should	be	always	kept	in	a	box	when	not	in	use.	
c. Assistive devices (sticks, walker etc.)
•	 You	should	keep	the	sticks	or	walker	nearby	the	elderly.	
•	 They	should	be	kept	away	from	water	to	avoid	rusting.		
•	 They	should	be	cleaned	regularly.		
7. Assisting MPW (F/M) for the nursing tasks: In case any elderly individual requires nursing 
care like changing dressing or wound care etc., you may support the caregiver for the same. You 
will	also	assist	MPW(F)	if	they	carry	out	any	nursing	task.	You	are	not	required	to	carry	it	out	on	
your own."

ASHA NCD Module-English,1,"Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases   |   1Introduction
In the last ten years, we have seen improvements in the health of mothers and children. This 
includes an increase in institutional deliveries, immunization coverage, improvements in infant and child health, and reductions in maternal and infant deaths. You, as an ASHA, have played a large role in making this happen. 
You were selected as an ASHA to serve your community and improve health outcomes 
for the people. So far, you have been trained on topics related to maternal, new born, child health, nutrition and infectious diseases. You were also trained on issues such as improving communication skills, negotiation and building community relationships, reaching the most vulnerable or remote populations, and on addressing violence against women in the community. 
The country has made progress in improving maternal and child health and communicable 
diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and leprosy. But now, we face another set of health challenges. You must have heard in your community that people complain of having high blood pressure or high blood sugar or suffering from cancers. 
These complaints are heard across the country. More and more people are affected by 
diseases like heart attacks and stroke, cancer, asthma and breathing difficulty, mental disorder injuries, kidney, liver and other problems. These diseases are called Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). 
This module will tell you more about these NCDs. It will also guide you on how you can 
help people in the community in preventing NCDs and in identifying and supporting those who are affected by them. However, you must remember that your efforts on community prevention and control of communicable diseases and in improving maternal child health, continue to be important.
Let us first understand what we mean by Non-Communicable Diseases?
NCDs are diseases of long duration. These are non-infectious conditions that cannot be transmitted to other individuals. Some NCDs progress slowly or cause chronic symptoms requiring long term care and control while others progress rapidly. They affect adult men and women but children are vulnerable as well. People may appear healthy but still suffer from these conditions. 
One of the most serious concerns about NCDs is that they affect people in the productive 
years of their life. They also cause “premature deaths” -  that is, a death occurring before the average life expectancy. Though NCDs can affect a person at any age, older individuals are more vulnerable to NCDs.Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases"
ASHA NCD Module-English,2,"2   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesIn this module, you will be trained on five common NCDs:
l	Hypertension.
l	Diabetes.
l	Cervical Cancer.
l	Breast Cancer.
l	Oral Cancer.
Besides these, there are other NCDs like epilepsy, asthma and other respiratory 
diseases, but you will be taught about them in later modules. 
As an ASHA, you are in the unique position of being able to reach every individual 
and family. Over time, you have gained credibility and respect in the community. This module builds on your existing knowledge and skills by providing you with new information and skills. 
Training in this module will help you:
l Build your knowledge of the risk factors, prevention and control of common Non-
Communicable Diseases and guide you on how to mobilise the community on these issues.
l Strengthen your understanding of the programmes for Non-Communicable Diseases in your area including screening, early detection and referral.
“Didi, people are 
asking why get tested when they are not ill?”Didi, they are charging me money for checking blood sugar and blood pressure at the government hospital and I don’t have the money to pay -  Can you help me?
Didi, my blood sugar level is high. Do I have to go to the far away town or is there something you can suggest?
Didi, I have diabetes.  
Do I have to take medicines throughout my life?Didi, I have an ulcer in my mouth, what shall I do?"
ASHA NCD Module-English,3,"Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases   |   3In Chapter 1, you will learn about health promotion by which people can take 
control of their behaviours and improve their health. 
In Chapter 2, you will understand risk factors associated with common Non-Communicable Diseases and their prevention.
In Chapter 3 and 4, you will learn about Hypertension and Diabetes.
In Chapter 5, you will learn about important details of common Cancers (Oral, Breast and Cervical).In this module, there are six chapters and each chapter deals with a specific aspect of common NCDs and their risk factors. This module is organised as follows:
In Chapter 6, you will learn about tasks of the ASHA.
l Learn basic skills to assess and counsel individual and families on modifying life style behaviours and promoting health.
l Gain competencies in measuring key parameters and using checklists related to Non-Communicable Diseases.
l Learn how to follow-up patients with Non Communicable Diseases, help patients take their medication regularly and make changes in their lifestyles.
l Become familiar with checklist and records to be maintained."
ASHA NCD Module-English,4,"4   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesWhat is Health promotion? 
Health promotion focuses on 
l	Keeping people healthy.
l	Helping people make changes in lifestyles to prevent diseases. 
l	Motivating behaviour changes to avoid complications among those with diseases.
Importance of Health Promotion?
The purpose of health promotion is to improve the health behaviour of individuals and 
communities and make positive changes in the living and working conditions that affect their health.
l	Health promotion improves the health status of individuals, families, communities.
l	Health promotion enhances the quality of life for all people.
l	Health promotion reduces premature deaths.
l	By focusing on prevention, health promotion reduces the costs (both financial and human) that individuals and communities would spend on medical treatment.
Health Promotion and Healthy Lifestyle
Health Promotion has a lifelong effect. The earlier health promotion begins, the better its effects are. A healthy lifestyle is one which helps to improve people’s health and wellbeing. It improves critical health indicators such as weight, blood sugar, blood pressure, and blood cholesterol. Importance of Health PromotionChapter 1
In this Chapter,  you will learn about:
l Health Promotion.
l Importance of Health Promotion.
l Linkages of Health Promotion to Healthy Lifestyles."
ASHA NCD Module-English,5,"Importance of Health Promotion   |   5Health promotion is thus about eating healthy food, avoiding unhealthy food, and 
ensuring positive social, environmental and occupational conditions so that where one lives and works plays a major role towards health and wellbeing of an individual. However, when giving people advice about health promotion, you must understand their current lifestyles and be sensitive to their specific needs.
There are wide health gaps between the rich and poor in India, so a single health promotion 
programme will not fit everybody. Health promotion messages should be adapted to the local needs of the community and take into account different behaviours and lifestyles. For example: Asking a construction worker to exercise daily for 30 minutes is not a 
good advice as she/he is already engaged in active physical work throughout the day. 
Ensuring a safe working environment, preventing work place related accidents, safe drinking water and sanitation should be a priority for her/his health and wellbeing.
For example: Recommending expensive dietary options to those who cannot afford 
to have even one full meal a day is being insensitive to realities of poor people’s lives. However, encouraging people to consume traditional foods that are locally available would meet their nutritional needs without imposing high costs.
Healthy living include healthy 
eating, physical activities, good personal hygiene, weight management, stress management, avoiding tobacco, drugs, and the harmful use of alcohol. 
Healthy lifestyle is associated with:
l Health awareness.
l Work safety.
l Living in safe environments.
l Good nutrition.
l Adequate sleeping patterns.
l Physical fitness and regular 
exercise.
l Absence of addiction.
l Good personal hygiene.
l Positive social communication.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,6,"6   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesPromoting healthy habits ensures:
l Healthy families and communities
l Reduced cost of treatment for illnesses
l Better quality of life
l Avoiding lost wages on account of sickness
T arget Population
Health promotion should be targeted across 
all age groups. 
Special focus should be given to adolescents 
and young adults. The earlier an individual begins a healthy lifestyle, the easier it will be to maintain the good habits upon reaching adulthood and throughout one’s life.

ASHA NCD Module-English,7,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   7What are Risk Factors?
A risk factor is a condition or behaviour that increases the chances of developing a 
particular disease. Here are some examples of risky behaviours that can cause diseases.Risk Factors for Non-Communicable DiseasesChapter 2
In this Chapter,  you will learn about:
l Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases.
l Identification of Risk Factors.
l Raising Awareness and Mobilising Community to Modify Risk Factors.
Nawab is 24 years old has been chewing tobacco since he was ten years old. His teeth are discoloured and he keeps getting ulcers in his mouth. 
Rani and Shyam have moved from a rural area of Bihar to an urban construction site near Delhi. They are both construction workers and are at the working site from morning till evening. Because of the long working hours, Rani is too tired to cook at home. They regularly buy food from a nearby stall which sells deep fried ready to eat food like samosa, kachori, pakora, poori-sabji etc. and enjoy eating this food. Shyam also consumes alcohol on a daily basis.
Rafia is 40 years old. Recently she noticed a lump in her breast. Her mother and aunt had a history of breast cancer. Her aunt died when she was 45 years old.
Shabnam is a 50-year-old resident of Ratanpur. Both her parents 
had high blood pressure and her father died of stroke.
In these cases, we illustrate the various risk factors that are responsible for NCDs. Risk factors can be of two types: Non-modifiable and Modifiable risk factors."
ASHA NCD Module-English,8,"8   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesThe diagram below shows how risk factors can lead to NCDs. The more risk factors one 
has, the greater is the chance of getting a particular disease.
Non-modifiable risk factors
These risk factors are inherent to an individual and cannot be changed, such as age, family history and sex (as seen in the case of Rafia and Shabnam). 
l	Age: With increasing age, our body undergoes changes. As we grow older, there is an 
increase in the risk of developing high blood pressure, (Hypertension), high blood sugar levels, (Diabetes), high levels of body fat and blood fats. These conditions can lead to Non-Communicable Diseases like -  heart and blood vessel diseases (stroke), diabetes, cancer, respiratory problems, etc. 
l	Sex: Both women and men are at risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases. Men are at a higher risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases. However, women who have reached menopause are more likely to suffer from heart attacks than pre-menopausal women. Some risk factors for developing Non-Communicable Diseases such as high blood pressure or high blood glucose can affect women even during pregnancy.
l	Family history: The chances of getting some NCDs are higher if a close family member -  parents, siblings also have the disease. This is called Family History. If a person has a family history of NCDs she/he has a high chance of getting the disease.
Modifiable risk factors
These are risk factors that can be changed by specific action,. The harmful effect can be reduced with changes in lifestyle and treatment. Risk factors may affect the individual such as unhealthy diets, lack of physical activity, tobacco and alcohol consumption (as seen in the case of Nawab, Rani and Shyam). Population level risk factors include poverty, poor living and working conditions and environmental factors like pollution from factory smoke, cars and even cooking stove (chulha) in home, can increase the risk of many NCDs.
At the individual level, some modifiable risk factors can be changed if the person changes 
her/his individual behaviours. However, some factors also require changes at the level of Modifiable Risk Factors

ASHA NCD Module-English,9,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   9laws and government action, e.g. government should provide smokeless chulhas (stove) 
to reduce indoor pollutions or reduce air pollution by imposing fine on industries setup in residential areas. Also, there is a law against selling of tobacco products near schools and colleges so that children do not start smoking early.
Having one or more of these conditions such as -  high blood pressure, high blood 
glucose levels, high blood fat levels and excess body fat (being overweight) can result in Cardiovascular diseases (Heart disease, Stroke), Diabetes, Cancers and Chronic Respiratory Diseases (Asthma, difficulty in breathing). 
Are Non-Communicable Diseases Increasing? If so, then why?
Over the past few years, we are noticing an increase in deaths and illnesses due to Non-Communicable Diseases. Some of the reasons are: 
l	People shifting from rural areas to urban areas and making changes in lifestyles related to diet, exercise and other behaviours.
l	Increase life expectancy of people and thus more people living at an increasing age. 
l	Decrease in physical activity due to availability of motor vehicles for transport.
l	Lack of adequate, safe spaces for regular exercise.
l	Availability and use of tobacco and alcohol for all age groups.
l	Increased use of foods high in fats, salt, sugar and sugar sweetened beverages.
l	Low consumption of fruits and vegetables because of high costs/lower availability. 
l	Increased consumption of refined foods (foods that are available in packaged form).
l	Growing environmental pollution (air, food, water).
What is the Effect of Non-Communicable Diseases on the Poor 
and Women?
A common perception is that Non-Communicable Diseases 
are a disease of the rich. However, this understanding is not correct. Poor and vulnerable people can suffer from NCDs too. Two important factors that can cause NCDs are poverty and malnutrition. 
As you know, many children are born with low birth 
weight (weighing less than 2.5 kg at birth). The lack of nutrition for the baby while in the womb, has consequences in adulthood. While growing up, the bodies of such Low birth weight babies are not able to adapt to fatty or sugary foods. This results in an increase in risk factors like hypertension, high blood fat levels, and high blood glucose levels.
Poverty contributes to NCDs in several ways, including maternal malnutrition. Also, poor 
people are not able to buy and consume healthy foods such as nuts, fresh fruits, etc. As 
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,10,"10   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseasesa result, they often can only afford to eat rice or roti, with no pulses or vegetables. Also, 
particularly in the case of urban poor, long working hours do not leave them enough time to cook healthy meals, such as the use of leafy green vegetables or healthy grains that take longer to cook. The poor also live in places where there are higher risks of air pollution, such as near factories which release harmful chemicals. So, you can see that the risks of NCDs can be higher among the poor, when compared to the rich, who may have more time and money to invest in healthier lifestyles.
Non-Communicable Diseases are also associated with higher health care costs due to 
long and expensive treatment. With NCDs, you cannot stop taking medicines once you feel better – you have to keep taking them to keep illness away, often for a lifetime. But many people stop taking medicines once they feel better or when they run out of money. These illnesses also require close monitoring and regular follow up by a health service provider. The poor may not be able to visit a health centre regularly as that would mean loss of wages. High transportation costs to and from the health facility, lower energy to do work, lack of money to make healthy food choices and stress, are added factors leading to higher levels of Non-Communicable Diseases among the poor.
Treatment for Non-Communicable diseases is generally spread over a long period of time. 
In case of complications, people may need hospitalisation. This can lead to financial hardship. Such illnesses of even one family member could affect the family’s income. This may result in the children dropping out of school, or even affect the consumption of nutritious food for the rest of the family.
Women are particularly disadvantaged as they are often more vulnerable because of their 
status within the family and society. Poverty is a factor that increases this vulnerability. In comparison to men, they lack access to healthcare, have little control over the household income and are unable to make decisions for themselves regarding care and treatment. Also, as a tradition in many households, women eat leftovers which may not constitute a healthy dietary choice. Therefore, it is important to increase women’s awareness about Non-Communicable Diseases and ensure that they participate in screening and treatment programmes. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,11,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   11Why do People use T obacco and Alcohol?
Many people start smoking/chewing tobacco and consuming alcohol in their early 
twenties or even earlier. Adolescents may begin to use tobacco or alcohol in order to act older, or as a way of experimenting, to gain social acceptance among peers, or in stressful situations. Adults begin to smoke and drink to either overcome stress or pressures of daily life or for pleasure. Individuals react differently to the amount of alcohol they drink. While some individuals experience ill effects with even small quantities of alcohol, others can consume larger quantities without any harmful effects appearing immediately. 
It is also important to remember that in some parts of our country, drinking alcohol is 
part of the local tradition. Your task is to understand the harmful consequences of the use of these substances and communicate this to the people of your community. 
What are the Various Forms in which T obacco is Used?
There are smoking and smokeless forms of tobacco.
l		Smoking tobacco can be in the form of cigarettes, bidis, cigars, hukkahs or pipes. Bidi smoking is the most popular form of tobacco smoking in India.
l		Smokeless tobacco is consumed through chewing (through the mouth), sucking and applying tobacco preparations to the 
teeth and gums or inhaling. It is chewed (in the form of gutkha, zarda, mawa, pan masala (with tobacco) and pan (with tobacco) or khaini), applied as a paste in the form of gudakhu, gul, 
and inhaled in the form of snuff, chutta, etc. 2.1: Tobacco and Alcohol
In this Section,  you will learn about:
l Effects of Tobacco and Alcohol Consumption.
l Benefits of Quitting Tobacco and Alcohol.
l Withdrawal Symptoms among those who Quit Tobacco and Alcohol.
l Laws Related to Tobacco and Alcohol.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,12,"12   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesWhat is Passive Smoking?
Smoking cigarettes or bidis not only harms the individual’s health but also harms those 
who are standing nearby or sitting in the same room where an individual is smoking. Exposure to second hand smoking is called Passive Smoking. Children and women are especially exposed to the dangers of second-hand smoke, if they have a family member who smokes.
Passive smoking is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, heart attack, difficulty 
in breathing, coughing, asthma, ear infection, irritation to the eyes, nose and throat, and long-term negative effects on the brain. 
Effects of tobacco use 
Tobacco use is dangerous. The negative health effects include both long-term (i.e. future) and short-term (i.e. immediate) effects. The effects occur not only as a result of 
regular use, but even when used occasionally and in some cases, with exposure to passive smoking. The table below lists the effects of tobacco: 
Short Term Health Effects Long Term Health Effects
Asthma Eye problems like cataract 
Tooth decay/Gum disease Cancers of oral cavity, larynx (voice box), oesophagus 
(food pipe), lungs, stomach, throat and other cancers.
Trouble breathing Increased chances of Tuberculosis
Bad breath Heart Attack - Heart and blood vessel disease (stroke)
High Blood Pressure; Diabetes; Kidney DamageTobacco use in pregnancy leads to Low Birth Weight 
babies 
Respiratory/Breathing problemsImpotence and low fertility among men
India’s T obacco Cessation Programme 
In 2003, India introduced the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act (COTPA-2003). 
According to this Act, 
l	Smoking is completely banned in public places like hospitals, public transport like buses, trains, taxis, schools and colleges, parks, etc.
l	Tobacco products cannot be sold to person below the age of 18 years.
l	Tobacco cannot be sold in places within 100 metres from the educational institutions such as schools and colleges. 
l	Ban of advertisements on tobacco through electronic and print media.
The National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) is a programme launched by Government of India in 2007 to increase public awareness about the harmful effects of "
ASHA NCD Module-English,13,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   13tobacco use, training of healthcare providers on tobacco control, establishing clinics in 
healthcare facilities to quit tobacco, and to oversee effective implementation of COTPA.
You should know about this, so that you can educate community members on this aspect.
What are the Benefits of Giving up T obacco?
Even after a person has been consuming tobacco in any form for any period of time, giving 
up tobacco has several benefits. They include improvement in breathing, reduction in risk of heart attack, or cancer and improved health. However, giving up tobacco causes withdrawal symptoms for which the person needs to be supported by her/his family.
Withdrawal symptoms
When a person quits the habit of tobacco consumption, they are likely to have “withdrawal symptoms” . These include:
Headache Anxiety/feeling of worry, concern
Nausea/vomiting Depressed mood
Constipation or diarrhoea Increased hunger
Fatigue (tiredness), drowsiness and 
difficulty in sleepingIncreased desire for the taste of sweets
Irritability Desire for tobacco
 
Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by the support and encouragement of family and 
friends, finding ways of keeping oneself busy, drinking plenty of fluids, regular exercise, sufficient sleep and eating a balanced diet, or even simple things like carrying out deep breathing exercises.
What are the Various Forms of Alcohol?
Alcohol is consumed in India in many forms by all age groups: adolescents, men, women and older adults. There are various forms of alcohol:
l	Alcohol made from locally grown grains, vegetables and fruits. Eg. arrack, mahwa, 
tari (toddy) etc.
l	Distilled alcohol/foreign alcohol like whisky, rum etc.
l	Beer.
l	Locally made drinks which are illegal but consumed widely.
Although alcohol has been being widely used in India for a long time, in recent years the harmful use of alcohol has increased. This means that people are drinking in quantities which has harmful effects on body. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,14,"14   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesEffects of alcohol
l	Damages the heart, causes stroke and high blood pressure.
l	Increases the risk of developing certain cancers -  mouth, food pipe, throat, liver and 
breast.
l	Leads to a variety of problems related to the liver, kidney, pancreas.
l	Weakens the body’s ability to fight diseases.
l	Causes disorders of mind including alcohol dependence, suicidal tendencies, problems in behaviours leading to fights, violence, depression, injuries and accidents (resulting in untimely death).
l	Can result in a person being isolated or shunned by family and friends.
l	Can result in loss of livelihood -  causing the entire family to suffer. 
l	Drinking during pregnancy leads to complications during delivery and defects in the child.
Governments in the states and at the centre have taken certain actions to control and regulate alcohol consumption:
l	Prohibition of alcohol in few states like Gujarat, Bihar, Kerala etc.
l	Observation of “dry day” where consumption is prohibited during certain days of the week or month.
l	Ban of sale of alcohol to minors (age varies according to the state) and drinking in public places.
l	Prohibition of driving while under the influence of alcohol.
l	Ban of advertisements on alcohol through electronic and print media.

The role of ASHA in addressing tobacco and alcohol as 
risk factors
So far your work has largely dealt with female members of the community 
since you have worked mostly on women and children’s issues. However, as you begin to work on NCDs, communicating with men on topics such as the use of tobacco and alcohol is important. This may at first seem difficult. This is perhaps more in areas where there are barriers for open discussions between women and men. It is important for you to more actively seek the participation of members of the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee or members of the Mahila Arogya Samiti or other community groups, such as -  youth groups, SHG groups, etc. Your key tasks are to: 
1. Increase community awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco and 
alcohol to their health and the health of those around them. 
2. Improve understanding of the money spent on tobacco and alcohol use and the likely costs of treatment needed if they were to fall ill. 
3. Ensure that children and adolescents - both boys and girls are also aware regarding the effects of tobacco and alcohol use. The platform of adolescent meeting and Rashtriya Kishor Swasthya Karyakram (RKSK) can be used to disseminate these messages.
4. Work with individuals who use tobacco and alcohol and motivate them to 
quit these habits by explaining the harmful consequences of tobacco and alcohol use. Request the Male Multipurpose worker/ASHA Facilitator or male volunteers in your community to support you. 
5. Work with the VHSNC to undertake community activities to see how many young people use tobacco and alcohol and share this information in community. With the VHSNC you can organise community action against the availability of tobacco and alcohol - like set-up of shops, illegal supply and production of tobacco and alcohol in the community. This demands building solidarity and support for this cause from various women’s groups, other ASHAs, panchayat/ULB members, recognised healthcare providers etc.
6. Identify tobacco cessation centres and de-addiction centres that are in your area and provide information to people about how to access these centres. 
7. Mobilise on a priority basis, those who consume tobacco and alcohol to attend screening for Non-Communicable Diseases. Support those with hypertension and diabetes and motivate them to give up these habits."
ASHA NCD Module-English,16,"16   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesWhat is a Healthy Diet? 
In Modules 6 and 7 you have learnt about nutrition of the child and pregnant woman. In 
this module, you will learn how healthy eating habits are important in preventing and controlling non-communicable diseases.
There are four basic food groups listed in the table below. Eating foods from all food 
groups is called Dietary Diversity. It means that foods from all the basic four food groups should be eaten in proper quantities. 
The quantity of foods needed to meet body requirements differ with age, gender, body 
composition and physical activity. Thus those who engage in heavy work need to eat more, but those who do not do much activity need lower quantities. Many traditional foods that are fibre-rich like whole products -  wheat (atta products), jowar, bajra, maize, unhusked dals (with chilka), fruits and vegetables constitute a Healthy Diet. Eating such foods also helps to maintain a healthy body weight and reduces the risk of NCDs. Some Non-Communicable Diseases require food restrictions. People suffering from NCDs require specific dietary advice.2.2: Healthy Diet and Physical Activity
2.2.1. Healthy Diet
In this Section,  you will learn about:
l Classification of Food Groups with examples.
l Difference between a Healthy and an Unhealthy Diet.
l Effects of an Unhealthy Diet.
l How to make Healthy Food Choices.
l How Unhealthy Food Choices are due to lack of Information or Poverty, rather than Availability.
Classification of Food Groups with examples
Food Group Examples*
Cereals, Millets and Pulses Cereals - Wheat, wheat flour (atta/maida), rice 
(brown/white), rice flakes (chiwra), maize/corn, barley, oats, suji, vermicelli (sevian), puffed rice, etc.; 
Millets - Bajra, Ragi, Jowar; Pulses/dals and legumes - Bengal gram ( channa 
dal), Bengal gram flour (besan), green gram 
(moong dal ), black gram (urad dal), arhar dal 
(tur dal) chickpea (white/black/green chana), 
sprouted pulses, legumes like rajma, lobia, 
soyabean and its products, etc.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,17,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   17What is an Unhealthy Diet? 
In the last few years, there have been changes in the lifestyle of people in India in rural and 
urban areas. Improved economic growth and status among some people has led to dietary changes. Increasing poverty levels have also led to changes in people’s eating habits.
People have shifted from consuming traditional and fibre-rich foods like whole products 
- wheat (atta products), jowar, bajra, maize, unhusked dals (with outer covering), fruits and vegetables towards eating more processed foods like - white rice, maida, husked dals (without outer covering), foods of animal origin, foods available in packaged forms which are ready-to-eat and cook, etc. 
A diet rich in sugar, salt, fat, foods such as red meat - mutton, liver; milk and milk products 
such as full cream milk, butter, ghee, but low in the amount of fruits and vegetables is called an Unhealthy Diet. 
It is important however, to remember that healthy eating is not only the type of food 
consumed. It also refers to the way food is prepared and consumed. Food prepared with excess of fats, sugar, salt, or consumption of refined foods, ready-to-eat and packaged foods are all risk factors causing NCDs. Food Group Examples*
Vegetables and Fruits Green leafy vegetables - spinach, mustard 
leaves (sarson), fenugreek leaves, bathua, coriander leaves etc;
Other vegetables - carrots, onion, brinjal, 
ladies finger, cucumber, cauliflower, tomato, capsicum, cabbage etc;
**Starchy roots and tubers - potatoes, sweet 
potatoes, yam, colocasia and other root vegetables;
Fruits - Mango, guava, papaya, orange, sweet 
lime, watermelon, lemon, grapes, amla, etc.
Milk and Animal Products Milk and milk products - Milk, curd, skimmed milk, cheese, cottage cheese (paneer), etc.;
Animal products - Meat, egg, fish, chicken, liver, 
etc.
Oils, Fats, Sugars and Nuts Oils and Fats - Butter, ghee, vegetable cooking oils like groundnut oil, mustard oil, coconut oil, etc;
Sugars - Sugar, jaggery, honey;Nuts - peanuts, almonds, cashew nuts, 
pistachios, walnuts, etc. 
* These examples will change according to local crops and diets in different areas**  Starchy roots and tubers like potatoes, sweet potatoes (shakarkandi), yam (jimikand), colocasia (arbi) and other root  
vegetables; as well as fruits like banana are rich in starch which provide energy.

ASHA NCD Module-English,18,"18   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesHelping people make healthy food choices
The following points will help you to explain healthy food choices to your community.
l	Consume a variety of fresh, seasonal and locally available fruits and vegetables 
(including green leafy vegetables). 
l	Eat whole cereals and pulses (with outer covering) as they are high in fibre or roughage than refined cereals and pulses (without outer covering). Fibre/roughage helps in slowing down the absorption of sugar and fats into the blood.
l	Avoid eating processed foods or foods available in packets - these have high amount of fat, salt and sugar. 
l	Try to include foods from each of the four basic food groups shown in the table of food group classification.
l	Eat whole fruits as they are rich in natural fibre or roughage.An unhealthy diet during pregnancy increases the risk of premature delivery, low birth weight and birth defects. Such babies are more prone to develop Non-Communicable Diseases as adults.Effects of an Unhealthy Diet

The cost of vegetables and fruits has also risen. Ready-to-eat and packaged foods are hard to resist and easily available everywhere. Sometimes they are cheaper and easier to make when compared to healthy/fresh foods. 
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,19,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   19l	Avoid salt rich foods like papads, pickles, salted namkeens/savouries, etc. Those 
with family history of high blood pressure should especially reduce their daily salt consumption. 
l	Reduce the consumption of sugar rich foods. Those with family history of diabetes should be careful of the amount and type of food to be consumed. 
l	Restrict intake of red meat like mutton, liver, etc. and consume lean meats like chicken, fish, etc. 
l	Use vegetables oils like mustard oil, groundnut oil, soyabean oil, etc. for cooking. In practice, it is best to use a mixture of oils. 
l	Reduce the consumption of deep fried foods - samosa, vadas, kachori, pakoras, etc. 
l	Roadside vendors who sell fried foods, heat the same oil over and over again, The oil they use can lead to blocking/clogging of blood vessels and possibly to a heart attack and other Non-Communicable Diseases.
l	Drink plenty of water, at least 8-10 glasses of water daily. Beverages like water, buttermilk, lassi, coconut water, should be consumed instead of bottled soft drinks and readymade fruit juices.
Poverty as an underlying cause for unhealthy food choices 
Most information that is available through advertisements and newspapers, highlight that unhealthy foods (foods particularly rich in fats, sugars and salt). are the reasons for causing NCDs. They also urge people to eat more fruits, nuts and vegetables, eat more often, and use healthy oils in their cooking. 
These messages assume that such healthy foods are easily available to everyone, and that 
people have the time and money to purchase and prepare healthy foods.
However, poor people are unable to afford such dietary items on a regular basis.. Poor 
people tend to eat larger quantities of foods that are cheap but do not have much nutritional value. For instance, you will find people eating five or six chapattis, but with hardly any vegetables or only watery dal. Among rice eating communities, poor people cannot afford pulses and vegetables so they may eat a large quantity of rice, with just a little dal or buttermilk. 
Also, in rural areas, poor people may farm on plots of borrowed land. Even though they 
cultivate healthy grains/pulses or fruits and vegetables the major share of the harvest is taken away by the landowners.
Over the past few decades several environmental factors, changes in farming practices 
(farmers are no longer cultivating traditional grains and have shifted to wheat/rice cultivation) and food marketing strategies have affected the quality of diets. It has also resulted in decreased consumption of locally and regionally available foods which are nutritionally adequate (rich in all vital nutrients). All these changes have a higher adverse affect on the poor. "

you will learn about:
l Physical Activity.
l Benefits of Physical Activity in Adults.
l Daily Requirement of Physical Activity in Adults.
l How to Enable Adequate and Regular Physical Activity in your Community. 
What is Physical Activity?
l	Physical activity is any body movement that involves the use of muscles of the body, and requires energy. 
l	Examples: Walking, running, jogging, playing a sport, dancing, swimming, climbing the stairs, yoga, work like farming, lifting and moving heavy objects as in construction, household work like sweeping, cleaning, washing, dusting. 
Benefits of Physical Activity in adults
l	Maintains a healthy body weight and body fat distribution.
l	Protects against the development of heart diseases, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, joint problems and some cancers.
l	Builds and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints. 
l	Helps in managing painful conditions, like back pain or knee pain.
l	Improves mental health and alertness.
l	Helps to avoid fractures and falls.2.2.2. Physical Activity
How much Physical Activity is 
Needed for an Adult?
Adults should undertake at least 150 minutes 
of moderate exercise per week. This can be spread throughout the week e.g. 30 minutes of activity 5 times per week. 10 minutes of moderate activity can be done three times a day, that will add up to the 30 minutes of physical activity per day.
Examples of exercises are brisk walking 
(walking fast), climbing stairs, jogging, cycling, dancing, playing sports and games, yoga, carrying/moving moderate loads (<20kg), etc. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,21,"Risk Factors for Non-Communicable Diseases   |   21
Yo ga
Yoga is a popular form of physical exercise based upon asanas (physical postures), 
breathing techniques and meditation
Health Benefits of Y oga
l	Improves balance and flexibility.
l	Increases muscular strength and blood circulation.
l	Improves breathing.
l	Reduces lower back pain.
l	In addition to taking regular medicine, yoga can help in the management  
of diabetes, respiratory/breathing disorders, and other lifestyle related  disorders.
l	It helps to reduce depression, tiredness, anxiety/nervousness disorders and stress.
Enabling Adequate and Regular Physical Activity in  
your Community 
Members of a Self-Help Group in Tamil Nadu decided that 
they would meet every day at 7 pm when they had finished their household chores. Together they would walk to the village boundary which is nearly 2 km away. They also learnt yoga from a TV show and practiced it three times a week.
As seen from this example, given below are some ideas for people 
who do not engage in regular physical activity:
l	Choose an activity that fits into daily routine.
l Find time for exercise and make it a routine. 
l	 Exercising in groups improves motivation to exercise.
Please Note:  People suffering from heart problem, person with disabilities, 
pregnant women, or lactating women, and those with other health issues may 
need to do different amount and types of exercises to suit their condition. They should receive advice on this from the nurse or the Medical Officer at the PHC. Exercise should increase the heart rate. Household activities like sweeping, cleaning, 
washing, dusting, etc. do contribute to physical activity. However, doing only such household work alone may not meet the daily requirements. 
Advice on physical activity should be given according to the occupation and life style of 
individuals. For example, those who spend long hours in strenuous physical work such as working in the fields or as labourers, or carrying heavy loads may not need to engage in further physical activity. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,22,"22   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases
The role of ASHA in promoting healthy diet and 
physical activity
l	Educate community members on the importance of consuming a 
healthy diet and help them make healthy food choices based on local food availability.
l	Undertake group activities to raise awareness about various food groups that are locally available. 
l	Explain the benefits of physical activity and its role in preventing Non-Communicable Diseases. 
l	Work with the VHSNC/MAS and Panchayati Raj Institution (PRI)/ULB representatives to create spaces such as parks and walking areas that are safe and clean.
l	Plan group physical activity programmes. 
l	In your group or community meetings identify those with NCDs, undertake follow up through home visits to counsel them on diet modifications and undertaking regular physical activities.

Stress may lead to digestive problems, back or neck pain, sleeping problems, substance 
abuse, headaches, sleeplessness, depressed mood, anger and irritability. Stress contributes to health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, ulcers, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, anxiety disorder, and other illnesses. Handling stress depends on an individual’s personality. 2.3: Stress

The role of ASHA in helping people to manage stress
l	Help individuals identify the cause of stress.
l	Understand that stress management varies from person to person.
l	Help such individuals to build supportive relationships - A positive and stable bond between people that can provide emotional and social support is important. Talk to the individual’s family members, friends, community members to discuss the problem and reasons for stress. 
l	Motivate these individuals to exercise regularly - Walking, practicing yoga, jogging, etc. can all help improve mood and reduce stress.
l	Educate them to make positive changes in behaviour such as eating a healthy diet, control of anger, managing depression, appreciating the positives in oneself and others.
l	Help them seek care for health problems from an appropriate service provider.

ASHA NCD Module-English,24,"24   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesYou have read in the earlier chapters that we are seeing changes in 
life style related to eating habits, increasing consumption of tobacco, alcohol and reduced physical activity. This has affected the nutritional status leading to individuals becoming overweight. 
However, we also continue to see under nutrition not just among 
children but among adult women and men as well in many parts of the country. In your own area, you will see that there are both undernourished individuals and people who are overweight. 
The common perception is that Non-Communicable Diseases occur 
only in overweight individuals. However, undernourished women are more likely to have low birth weight babies, who are at increased risk of developing Non-Communicable Diseases when they grow into adults. We have discussed this earlier.
Causes of becoming Overweight
If the weight of an individual goes above a certain level, the person is referred to as being overweight. This is defined as having too much body fat in the body, which can lead to health problems. 
The main causes of becoming overweight are: 
l	Family history. 
l	Eating an unhealthy diet.
l	Lack of physical activity.
l	Presence of psychological factors - Depression, anxiety, stress, and low esteem can 
result in over eating.
l	Hormonal imbalance in the body.
You can see that some of these factors are preventable. 
Risks Associated with being Overweight
Being overweight can result in health problems, such as: 
l	Cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart diseases and stroke).
l	High blood fat levels (Eg. cholesterol).2.4: Overweight

l	Waist circumference should be taken on standing posture.
Process steps
l	Remove any layers of clothing blocking the waist. If the individual is unwilling to 
remove clothing the measurement can be taken over the thinnest layer of clothing.
l	The individual stands straight looking in front with abdomen (stomach) relaxed, arms at side and their feet fairly close together. 
l	You will stand in front, facing the subject. Find the midpoint between the lowest rib/bony point in front and top of hip bone in back. Waist circumferences can also be measured across the umbilical line.
l	The person should be asked to breathe normally. At the time of the reading of the measurement she/he asked to breathe out gently.Less than or 
equal to 90 cm in menLess than or equal to 80 cm in womenl	High blood pressure – Hypertension.
l	H igh blood sugar – Diabetes.

prostrate.
l	Diseases of the joints.
l	Lung disorders.
Diagnosing “Overweight” in Individuals 
In this section, you will learn how to diagnose an overweight individual through measuring waist circumference. Waist Circumference is a commonly used method to identify individuals at risk of being overweight at the community level and in the clinics. 
Waist Circumference (WC)
People who develop excess body fat especially around the waist are more likely to develop Non-Communicable Diseases even if they have no other risk factors. It can be measured by taking waist circumference in centimetres (cm). "
ASHA NCD Module-English,26,"26   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases
The role of ASHA in helping an individual reduce weight
l	Motivate the individual who is overweight to make a firm decision to lose 
weight and change lifestyle to become healthier.
l	Help her/him make small changes in lifestyle, for example if she/he is eating three chapattis, reduce to two or one gradually. 
l	Encourage the family members and friends to provide support and motivation to the overweight individual.
l	Advise her/him to reduce the amount of fried foods, foods rich in sugar and fat in their diets.
l	Explain that they should not resort to misleading measures that promise weight loss in a short term; pills, churan, mixtures, surgeries etc.
l	Motivate them to avoid consuming tobacco and drinking alcohol. 
l	Encourage them to incorporate regular physical exercise in their daily routine. 
l	Regular follow-up with the individual is required to monitor changes in their weight or any related health conditions.l	Place the tape firmly in a horizontal position making sure the measuring tape is parallel to the floor and not folded or twisted.
l	Record the reading at the end of the normal expiration/breathing.
l	The tape should be loose enough to allow the ASHA to place one finger between the tape and the person’s body but the tape should fit firmly but comfortably around the waist. The tape should not squeeze the skin.
l	Look at the place on the tape where the zero end meets the other end of the tape measure. The location of this meeting point is the waist measurement. 
l	Record the measurement in cms to the nearest 0.0 or 0.5 cm in the individual’s card or your register. Example - If the exact measurement is 85.7 cm, it should be recorded as 85.5 cm and if it is 85.9 cm, then record the reading as 86 cm.
Benefits of Reducing Weight 
The reduction of weight lowers the risk of
l	Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) – heart diseases, stroke.
l	H igh blood sugar – Diabetes.
l	Harmful blood fats.
l	High blood pressure – Hypertension.
l	Sleeping disorders.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,27,"Hypertension   |   27What is Hypertension?
Hypertension occurs when the blood moves through the blood vessels at a higher 
pressure than normal. This requires the heart to work harder to push blood through the blood vessels. This increases the load on the heart. 
Hypertension is also referred to as “silent killer”. This is because it can exist without 
causing any warning signs or symptoms . That is why it is important to screen all 
individuals at least above the age of 30 years for blood pressure at least once annually.
High blood pressure, if not controlled, may lead to damage of blood vessels, heart and 
other organs, such as the brain, kidneys and eyes. Constant high blood pressure can cause life - threatening conditions, such as heart diseases and stroke, diabetes, kidney diseases, etc. Reducing blood pressure to even a small extent can help lower the risk of these conditions.
Risk Factors for Hypertension 
The following are some common factors that can lead to high blood pressure
l	Family history. 
l	Unhealthy diet - A diet especially high in salt, fat and low in vegetables/fruits.
l	Lack of physical activity (or sedentary lifestyle).
l	Being overweight.HypertensionChapter 3

l	Excessive alcohol consumption. 
l	Chronic conditions such as kidney and hormone problems, diabetes, and high levels 
of harmful blood fats.
l	Stress.
In your community, the ANM, with your help will undertake screening of all adults 30 years and above, for hypertension. This will take place on a fixed day. Individuals who have normal blood pressure should be screened once in a year. Any individual diagnosed with high BP should be referred to a higher level for further diagnosis and management. 
It is the medical officer’s responsibility to develop a treatment plan for the patient, based 
on the level of blood pressure and the presence of other conditions such as high levels of blood glucose and fat. The treatment plan includes not just anti-hypertensive medication but also a plan for addressing any modifiable risk factors. It is part of your role to ensure that the patient adheres to the treatment and makes changes in her/his lifestyle to reduce modifiable risk factors.
Diagnosis of High Blood Pressure 
The only way to detect high blood pressure is to measure it using a BP apparatus. There are many kinds of BP apparatus. In this section, we will discuss the use of a Digital blood pressure machine. 
A blood pressure measurement gives you two readings 
(numbers). The upper one, which is higher of the two numbers, is called the systolic blood pressure. The lower number, which is also the smaller of the two numbers, is the diastolic blood pressure. 
In a screening programme, an individual with a 
systolic pressure (upper reading) of 140 mm Hg or more and a diastolic pressure (lower reading) of 90 mm Hg requires referral. 
Recording Blood Pressure
T ools
l	Digital blood pressure instrument. 
A digital blood pressure instrument measures blood pressure. It shows the readings on a small screen. It can be used by anyone with a little training. However confirmation of high blood pressure can only be made by a medical doctor. 
Important points to keep in mind
l	Ensure the patient is sitting comfortably with back supported, with their feet flat on the floor. The legs should not be crossed.
l	Ensure the measurement is taken in a quiet room with comfortable temperature.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,29,"Hypertension   |   29Process steps
A. How to apply the cuff
l	Ask the individual to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. 
When necessary, roll up the sleeves of the subject’s clothing.
l	Ensure the hand is relaxed. Place one arm of the participant on the table with the palm facing upward. Always use the same arm for blood pressure readings, as each arm will give you a slightly different reading.
l	Make sure the arm cuff is properly deflated (air is out) before placing it around the patient’s upper arm.
l	Ensure that the cuff is the correct size for the individual. If required use a smaller or larger cuff.
l	Wrap the cuff comfortably or snugly around the upper arm, and tie it up properly with the velcro tape.
l	Make sure the whole cuff is above the elbow, about 2cm (or 2 finger breadths) from the elbow.
l	Keep the level of the cuff at the same level as the heart during measurement. Make sure that the tubing falls over the front centre of the arm, so that the centre is correctly placed.
B. Recording blood pressure by using the digital blood pressure instrument
l	Press the START/STOP button to begin taking blood pressure measurement.
l	The BP cuff will start bloating up. This will compress the arm a bit and the patient may complain of pain. Reassure the patient that the pain is temporary.
l	The cuff will start to inflate and then slowly deflate so that the machine can take the measurement.
l	When the reading is complete, the blood pressure giving systolic and diastolic readings and pulse rate will appear on the screen.
l	If the monitor/machine does not record the reading, re-position the cuff and try again after 1-2 minutes and repeat the steps as mentioned above. 
l	Record the reading either in the machine or in family card of the person.
l	It is suggested to take a minimum of 2 readings at interval of 1 minute. The average of those readings should be used to represent the patient’s blood pressure.
l	Additional readings should be taken if the difference between the first two is greater than 5 mm Hg, and then the average of these multiple readings is used.
l	Press the START/STOP button to turn the machine off. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,30,"30   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesWhy is it Important to Check Blood Pressure even among those 
without any Symptoms? 
Regular screening of blood pressure helps in making an early diagnosis of hypertension. 
This is helpful in taking early corrective measures leading to better control of blood pressure. Please Note: A single high reading (more than normal) does not necessarily 
mean that the person has high blood pressure. The measurement must be 
repeated. 
The role of ASHA in management and control of high 
blood pressure
ASHA should motivate those with high blood pressure to:
l	Stop the use of tobacco in any form (smoking or chewing), also avoid 
exposure to second-hand smoke.
l	Reduce the intake of alcohol.
l	Reduce the amount of salt - maximum of 1 teaspoon (5 gms) of salt for the whole day.
l	Decrease consumption of refined cereals, high fat/oily foods, sugary foods.
l	Decrease excess amount of tea, coffee, cola drinks (rich in caffeine). 
l	Increase fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains and whole pulses.
l	Maintain healthy weight; people who are overweight need to lose weight.
l	Ensure regular physical activity.
l	Ensure monthly monitoring of blood pressure.
l	Compliance to treatment plan for drugs.
l	Regular check-up at the PHC/CHC as advised.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,31,"Hypertension   |   31Principles of Drug T reatment for Hypertension
The Medical Officer at the PHC will decide on the drug therapy for the patient. Whether a 
person requires medicines for his high blood pressure and which medicine is best for the patient would depend on:
l	The blood pressure reading.
l	Whether the high blood pressure has already affected the heart, kidneys, eyes and blood vessels.
l	Existing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease and other risk factors like use of unhealthy dietary habits, lack of physical activity or low physical activity, tobacco, alcohol, overweight and high levels of harmful blood fats. 
l	Other considerations will be age, sex (male/female) and body weight. 
There are several classes of medicines that can be used for the management of hypertension, diabetes and common cancers. Every state has its Essential Drug List (EDL) for common diseases available. The essential drugs for Hypertension, Diabetes and Common Cancers are expected to be available at the PHC, CHC and higher heath facilities. This essential drug list is updated on a regular basis and varies state-wise. 
Drugs for hypertension are available free of cost to those patients who use government 
health facilities. The drugs are prescribed by the medical officer and the patient should be given a month’s supply of drugs. The patient should be able to collect refills every month from the nearest health facility. This could be a Sub-Centre (SC) or a Primary Health Centre (PHC).
The blood pressure reading should be monitored regularly. The frequency depends on 
the advice of the medical officer. In some states, ASHA may also be given the digital instruments to measure BP of those who are under treatment to make sure they are taking their medication and their blood pressure is under control.
Heart Attack
A person who has hypertension is at risk for having a heart attack and stroke. These are complications of hypertension.
Heart attack is defined as severe chest pain for more than 30 minutes, radiating to left 
arm and not relieved by pain killers. It is associated with nausea, vomiting and sweating.
Risk factors of heart attack
l	High blood pressure (hypertension).
l	High blood glucose level (diabetes).
l	Excess alcohol intake.
l	Unhealthy foods.
l	Smoking.
l	Being overweight. 
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,32,"32   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesReasons for heart attack
The heart pumps blood through blood vessels to supply oxygen to all parts of our body. 
Factors such as age, family history and eating high fat diets can cause fat to settle in the calls of the blood vessels. This can cause the vessel to become narrow or blocked and reduce the blood flow. This leads to a heart attack.
Warning signs
l	Pain, pressure or constriction in the centre of the chest for more than 30 minutes.
l	Nausea. 
l	Unconsciousness.
l	Pain in jaw, neck, arms, shoulders or back.
l	Shortness of breath.
Stroke
Stroke is defined as paralysis or numbness of one side of the body. It can also cause, difficulty of speech, hearing, reading or writing. Stroke is due to a lack of blood supply to the brain. The lack of blood supply may be due to a blood clot/break in the blood vessel. A stroke is a medical emergency.

The role of ASHA in control of heart attack and stroke
Knowing the warning signs of heart attack and stroke and seeking immediate 
medical help can improve the outcomes. Individuals with any of the signs of heart attack and stroke should be referred immediately to a CHC for assessment and management.
Simple ways of preventing heart attack and stroke are
l	The ASHA should ensure that all women and men of 30 years of age and 
above are screened annually for hypertension and diabetes. 
l	Blood pressure and blood sugar should be monitored regularly in high-risk individuals – including those with a family history of stroke or heart attack.
l	Motivate those with high blood pressure and high blood sugar to change lifestyles and regularly take their medicines. 
l	Encourage individuals with hypertension and diabetes to avoid refined cereals, sugar, salt and fats in the diet; and eat foods that are high in fibre like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, whole pulses with outer covering and their products.
l	Encourage them to incorporate regular and adequate amount of physical exercise in their daily routine.
l	Motivate them to avoid the use of tobacco and alcohol. 
l	Help them maintain healthy weight; people who are overweight need to lose weight.
l	Help them adopt strategies to cope with stress (as discussed in the chapter on Stress).
l	Emphasise that if there are any signs of heart attack or stroke, she/he should seek immediate medical attention by a qualified health professional at the higher facilities.
l	Encourage patients to follow medical advice provided by a qualified health professional and ensure compliance to treatment.

What is Diabetes?
All food that we eat is broken down into a sugar called glucose. 
Glucose is carried by the blood to all the parts of the body to give energy. The hormone which helps glucose move from the blood into the cells, is called INSULIN. 
Insulin helps to keep the blood sugar levels normal. In diabetes, the 
body does not produce insulin or cannot use the insulin properly. The glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in high blood glucose levels. DiabetesChapter 4
In this Chapter,  you will learn about:
l Different Types of Diabetes, (Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational Diabetes).
l Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes.
l Common Signs and Symptoms for Type 2 Diabetes.
l Estimation of Blood Glucose using Glucometer.
l Management and Control of Diabetes.
Types of Diabetes What is it? Who gets it?
Type 1 Diabetes  Body does not produce 
insulin at all. People with this form of diabetes require daily injections of insulin in order to control the levels of glucose in their blood. The disease can affect people of any age, but usually starts in childhood or young adults.Diabetes is classified into three types namely Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational Diabetes."
ASHA NCD Module-English,35,"Diabetes   |   35Types of Diabetes What is it? Who gets it?
Type 2 Diabetes This is the  most common 
type of diabetes. The body 
produces some insulin, but 
not enough. This type of diabetes used to be seen only in adults but it is now also occurring increasingly in children and adolescents. It is seen in those with a family history of diabetes, excess body weight, lack of physical activity, and as people grow older. 
Gestational DiabetesDiabetes which occurs among women during pregnancy. Has a risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery The children of women with Gestational Diabetes are at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in the future
In this section, we will only discuss about Type 2 Diabetes as it is the most common.
Risk Factors for T ype 2 Diabetes
l	Family history of diabetes.
l	It occurs most frequently in adults, but is seen increasingly in adolescents as well.
l	Being overweight.
l	Unhealthy eating habits.
l	Lack of physical activity.
l	High blood pressure.
l	High levels of harmful blood fats. 
l	Addictions like tobacco use, drug and harmful use of alcohol. 
l	If the woman during pregnancy had diabetes or even mild elevation of blood sugar 
level during pregnancy.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,36,"36   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesIn your community, the ANM, with your help will undertake screening of all adults of 30 
years and above for diabetes. This will take place on a fixed day. Individuals who have normal blood glucose should be screened once in a year. Any individual diagnosed with high Blood sugar should be referred to a higher level for further diagnosis and management. 
It is the medical officer’s responsibility to develop a treatment plan for the patient, based 
on the level of blood glucose and the presence of other conditions such as high levels of blood pressure and fat. The treatment plan includes not just anti-diabetic medication but also a plan for addressing any modifiable risk factors. Your role is to ensure that the patient adheres to the treatment and makes changes in her/his lifestyle to reduce modifiable risk factors.
Blood Glucose Estimation
A glucometer is a device used to determine glucose levels in the blood. It enables a blood glucose check using a small drop of blood. For the purposes of screening, any patient with a random blood sugar over 140 mg/dl should be referred to the medical officer for further investigation. 
Blood glucose estimation using a glucometer

ASHA NCD Module-English,37,"Diabetes   |   37A glucometer is an instrument used to determine glucose levels in the blood. 
Process steps
1. Wash your hands to prevent infection.
2. Ask the participant to wash and dry their hands thoroughly.
3. Place the glucometer on a flat surface.
4. Open the lancet device provided with the glucometer. 
5. Insert the lancet. Take the sealing cap off the needle. Do not touch the needle. Close 
the device. Set the spring of the device so that it is ready to use by pressing or pulling the load button on the lancet device.
6. Clean the fingertip of the subject prior to needle prick. 
7. Turn on the glucometer and place a test strip in the machine when the machine is ready. One end will need to face the top of the glucometer; usually it has a dark coloured line on it. This is where the blood will be placed for testing. Watch the indicator for indication to place a blood drop onto the strip. 
8. Use a lancet to prick the side or top of the finger to get small amount of blood. Let the blood flow freely from the fingertip; do not squeeze the finger. Squeezing the finger can affect the results. Rubbing/Milking your finger before pricking it helps in easy availability of a blood droplet for the meter.  
9. Place the drop of blood on the test strip. The blood drop is to be placed against the edge or top of the strip. Wipe away the first drop of blood because it may be contaminated with tissue fluid or debris. 
10. Apply cotton ball to subject’s finger and hold firmly until bleeding stops. 
11. Watch the glucometer screen. It should show a “waiting” or “processing” symbol, and will produce a beep when the sample has been tested. The results will be displayed as a number on the screen.
12. Note the reading in the notebook or family folder of the subject. Keeping a record will make it easier to identify the subjects who need referral, and for the doctor to establish a good treatment plan. 
13. Turn the glucometer off. 
14. Place the used needle device into the sharps bin immediately.
15. Dispose of test strip into clinical waste bin before removing gloves. 
16. If sharp bin and clinical waste bin are not available; then use two separate boxes to store the sharp disposal and clinical waste products separately. After the blood glucose test; these boxes need to be transferred to bio-hazard container. Always wear gloves before transferring the bio-hazard products. (be alert to avoid needle pricks).
17. Use an alcohol based wipe to clean the meter ensuring all external surfaces are clean.
18. If the reading is high, then the individual should be referred to a medical professional for check-up."
ASHA NCD Module-English,38,"38   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesWhat is Hypoglycaemia (Low Blood Glucose)?
Among those with Diabetes a condition called – Hypoglycaemia 
or low blood sugar levels can occur. Hypoglycaemia occurs when 
blood sugar (glucose) level falls below a level of 70 milligrams per decilitre (mg/dl) or less. 
Symptoms are tremors, nervousness or anxiety, sweating, 
irritability, confusion, rapid/fast heartbeat, dizziness, hunger, nausea, blurred/impaired vision, headaches, weakness or fatigue, lack of coordination, seizures, unconsciousness, etc. 
There are several reasons why this may happen. One cause can be 
a long gap between two meals. The other common reason is side effects of some anti-diabetic drugs. 
Hypoglycaemia can be treated by consuming a small amount 
of sugar-rich foods as soon as symptoms appear. For such an emergency, diabetic patients should be advised to always carry something to eat such as loose sugar, rock candy (misri) or toffee etc. 
Motivating diabetics to regularly monitor blood glucose levels, 
eat regular meals, creating awareness on hypoglycaemia and providing a tailor-made treatment plan with drugs, etc. are some of the ways to prevent Hypoglycaemia amongst diabetic patients.
Management and Control of Diabetes
Change in lifestyle behaviours is effective in preventing or delaying the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes or the onset of complications. They include
l	Maintaining a healthy body weight - avoid excess weight gain. 
l	Regular physical activity of at least 30 minutes of regular activity for at least 5 days a week. Higher levels of activity are required for weight control.
l	Take regular small frequent meals. Skipping a meal can lead to low blood sugar level. Eat a balanced and healthy diet-avoiding sugar, salt and fats in the diet. 
l	Eat foods that are high in fibre like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cereals, whole pulses with chilka (skin) and their products.
l	Avoid tobacco in any form.
l	Avoid drinking alcohol.
l	Regularly check the blood sugar levels.
l	Follow medical advice of the doctor."
ASHA NCD Module-English,39,"Diabetes   |   39Principles of drug therapy for type 2 diabetes
The Medical Officer at the PHC will decide on the drug therapy for the patient. Whether a 
person requires medicines and which medicine is best for the patient would depend on:
l	The blood sugar reading. 
l	Whether the high blood sugar levels have already affected organs in the body such as heart, kidneys, eyes and blood vessels. 
l	Other medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, nerve and eye damage, and other risk factors like use of unhealthy dietary habits, lack of physical activity or low physical activity, tobacco, alcohol, overweight and high levels of harmful blood fats, etc.
l	Other considerations such as age, sex (male/female) and body weight. 
There are several classes of medicines that can be used for the management of hypertension, diabetes and common cancers. Every state has its Essential Drug List (EDL) for common diseases available. The essential drugs for Diabetes are expected to be available at the PHC, CHC and higher heath facilities. This essential drug list is updated on a regular basis and varies state-wise.
Drugs for diabetes are available free of cost to those patients who use government health 
facilities. The drugs are prescribed by the medical officer and the patient should be given a month’s supply of drugs. For diabetes, both oral dugs and Insulin injections can be provided based on the decision of the Medical Officer. 
The patient should be able to collect refills every month from the nearest health facility. 
This could be a Sub-Centre (SC) or a Primary Health Centre (PHC).
The role of ASHA in management and control of high blood sugar 
levels (this also applies to those with high blood pressure).
ASHA should motivate those with high blood sugar levels to:
l	Increase consumption of foods rich in fibre - variety of seasonal and fresh fruits, 
vegetables (including green leafy vegetables); whole grains and whole pulses and their products.
l	Decrease consumption of refined cereals, foods rich in excess amount of fat/oil, foods rich in salt and sugar.
l	Reduce the amount of salt : A maximum of 1 teaspoon (5 gms) of salt for the whole day  should be consumed by those who have high blood pressure. 
l	Sugar should be avoided amongst those diagnosed with diabetes."
ASHA NCD Module-English,40,"40   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases
l	Stop the use of tobacco in any form (smoking or chewing), also avoid exposure to 
second-hand smoke. 
l	Reduce the intake of alcohol. 
l	Decrease excess amount of tea, coffee, cola drinks (all are rich in caffeine).
l	Maintain healthy weight; people who are overweight need to lose weight.
l	Ensure regular and adequate physical activity.
l	Adopt strategies to cope with stress. 
l	Help the individual to maintain a healthy blood pressure and control of blood sugar levels by preventing and controlling the risk factors and ensure monthly monitoring of blood pressure and blood sugar. 
l	Follow-up of the patients referred to the health facilities/referral centres and support them through the consultation and diagnostic processes as required.
l	Compliance to treatment plan for drugs as advised by the medical doctor. 
l	Be alert to new signs and symptoms - they may be due to side-effects of the medicines being taken.
l	Regular check-up at the PHC/CHC or higher facilities as advised.
l	Ensure that the patient and their family members receive education on diabetes management and life style modifications. 
l	Regularly conduct home-visits by prioritising those households which are vulnerable and marginalised, where there are treatment defaulters or those who experience complications and bring these cases to the notice of the ANM and the Medical Officer.
l	Several people in your community will ask you about home remedies or other medicines from Ayurveda, Homeopathy etc. You should tell them to consult the medical officer before changing any medication.

ASHA NCD Module-English,41,"Cancer   |   41What is Cancer?
Cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled division of cells in any part of the body. This 
causes abnormal growth of that part of the body. The cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the blood. There are various kinds of cancers that are prevalent in our country. In this module, we are specifically going to address only the three most commonly occurring cancers in India - cancer of the cervix and breast among women and oral cancers in women and men.
These three are commonly occurring cancers in India. Together, they account for 
approximately 34% of all cancers in India. If these cancers are diagnosed early and treated appropriately, chances of survival are good. Thus, regular screening programmes which can diagnose cancers at early stages are an important preventive health programme.
5.1: Cervical Cancer
Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer
l	Multiple sexual partners.
l	Unprotected sex.
l	Early marriage.
l	Early age at first child birth.
l	Higher numbers of pregnancy and childbirth. 
l	Smoking.CancerChapter 5
In this Chapter,  you will learn about:
l Common Types of Cancer (Breast, Cervical and Oral Cancer)

ASHA NCD Module-English,42,"42   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesCommon Signs and Symptoms of Cervical Cancer
l	Bleeding between periods.
l	Bleeding after sexual intercourse.
l	Bleeding in post - menopausal women.
l	Pain during sexual intercourse.
l	Foul smelling vaginal discharge.
l	Vaginal discharge tinged with blood.
l	Pelvic pain.
l	Fatigue.
l	Unexplained weight loss.
l	Pain during urination.
Screening of Cervical Cancer
Screening would normally be undertaken at a Primary health Centre or Community 
health Centre by a trained doctor or by a trained nurse or by a gynaecologist. Screening or regular check-ups for cervical cancer are important, since during the early stages, women may experience no symptoms. Cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable cancers when detected at early stage. A common method for screening cancer is VIA (Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid). 
Screening should be done in a separate room from regular OPD, and if a separate room is not available then a curtain should be used to maintain privacy.
l	Approximately 30 women can be screened in a day, so screening should be planned accordingly.
l	Once an abnormality is detected, the individual should be referred to a gynaecologist. 
l	Your role is to mobilise all women over 30 years of age to be screened at least once in five years. For those women with a family history or those who develop these symptoms at any time, this should be done as soon as possible. Such patients should be referred to a health facility at any time."
ASHA NCD Module-English,43,"Cancer   |   435.2: Breast Cancer
 
Risk Factors
l	Early onset of menstrual period.
l	Late menopause.
l	Late age at first child birth.
l	Alcohol and tobacco use.
l	Family history.
l	Being overweight.
l	Lack of physical activity.
l	Shorter duration or no breastfeeding.
Common Signs and Symptoms of Breast Cancer
l	A change in size of the breasts.
l	A nipple that is pulled in or changed in position or shape.
l	A rash on or around the nipple.
l	Discharge from one or both nipples.
l	Puckering or dimpling of skin of the breasts.
l	Lump or thickening in the breast.
l	Constant pain in the breast or armpit.
Women over 30 years should be screened by a trained provider, at least once in five years. 
Those who have a family history of breast cancer should be encouraged to gets screened more often. 
Screening for breast cancer can be done by a trained health workers such as an ANM at 
the sub centre. This is called Clinical Breast examination. Any of the signs above should be considered suspicious and the woman should be referred to a medical officer. 
What is Breast Self-Examination (BSE)
Breast self-examination is recommended to raise awareness of breast cancer. The practice of BSE empowers women to take responsibility for their health. However this is not a 
substitute for examination by a trained provider. 
Best time to undertake BSE:
l	7-10 days after the first day of the menstrual period.
l	If not menstruating, pick a certain day - such as the first day of each month. 
l	If taking hormones, then do it 1-2 days after withdrawal bleeding."
ASHA NCD Module-English,44,"44   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesSteps of Breast Self-Examination (BSE)
Five steps of BSE
Step 1: Begin by looking at your breasts in the mirror with 
shoulders straight and arms on hips.
What to look for:
l	Any change from the usual size, shape, and colour.
l	Any visible distortion or swelling of the breast. 
If any of the following changes are seen, bring them to your 
doctor's attention:
l	Dimpling, puckering, or bulging of the skin.
l	A nipple that has changed position or an inverted nipple 
(pushed inward instead of sticking out).
l	Redness, soreness, rash, or swelling.
Step 2: Same changes to be looked for with arms raised. 
Step 3: Also look for any signs of fluid coming out of one or 
both nipples (this could be a watery, milky, or yellow fluid or blood).
Step 4: Next, feel breasts while lying down, using the right 
hand to feel the left breast and then the left hand to feel the right breast. Use a firm, smooth touch with the finger pads of your hand, keeping the fingers flat and together. Use a circular motion, about the size of a quarter.
Cover the entire breast from top to bottom, side to side — 
from your collarbone to the top of the abdomen, and from the armpit to your cleavage.
l	Follow a pattern to be sure that the whole breast is covered. 
l	Begin at the nipple, moving in larger and larger circles until the outer edge of the breast is reached.
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,45,"Cancer   |   45l	Ensure that all the tissue from the front to the back of the 
breasts is examined. For the skin and tissue just beneath, use light pressure; use medium pressure for tissue in the middle of your breasts; use firm pressure for the deep tissue in the back. 
l	When the deep tissue is reached, the individual should be able to feel down to the ribcage.
Step 5: Finally, the breasts should be examined while standing or sitting. Many women find that the easiest way to feel their breasts is when their skin is wet and slippery, so this can be done while taking a bath, using the same hand movements described in Step 4.

Screening of Oral Cancer
Like other cancers, every individual (woman or man) of 30 years and above should be 
screened by a trained provider, at least once in five years. Those who use tobacco in any form should be encouraged to be screened more often. In the case of individuals who have been using tobacco from a young age, they should be motivated to undergo examination by a trained provider, even if they are not thirty years old. 
Screening for oral cancer can be done by a trained health workers such as an ANM at the 
sub centre. This is called Oral Visual Examination. 
Oral cavity should be examined thoroughly using a mouth mirror and a white light. A 
torch can be used for proper light. Any abnormal patch (white/red), ulcer, rough area, granular area or swelling is to be considered for further examination at a referral facility. 
l	Self-examination can detect oral lesions at an early stage.
l	All habitual tobacco users should do self-examination of oral cavity on a monthly basis.
l	Method of doing Self-examination of oral cavity:
		 Rinse the mouth with water and stand before a mirror in adequate light.
		 Normal oral cavity lining is soft and pink.
			 Look in the mirror for any abnormal white or red patch, ulcer or roughened area, granular area or swelling in the mouth.
		 Consult a doctor if any abnormal area is found.

ASHA NCD Module-English,48,"48   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseases
The role of the ASHA
l	You must remember that all cases who may have one or more signs 
of cancer, may not actually have cancer. Several people who undergo screening may have one sign or more, but unless this is proved by biopsy, it cannot be confirmed. You must take care not to create a panic situation by informing people that they have cancer before this is confirmed by a medical doctor. 
l	Cancer treatment is long and causes both emotional and financial stress to the family. One of your tasks should be to support the family through visits, helping them to access the services in the health system and encourage the community to help them as required.
l	Encourage the patients undergoing cancer treatment to have fresh, hygienic, well-cooked foods, avoid alcohol and tobacco in any form.
l	People receiving cancer treatment specially with medicines may have a higher risk of acquiring infections. You can play an important role in informing patients and families on adopting methods for preventing infections. These include-tips for handwashing, body hygiene, oral hygiene, and avoiding crowded places or covering the face with a mask while in crowded places. 
l	The cost of cancer treatment for poor patients is often free. Different states have schemes that will take care of these costs. You should find out what happens in your state, so that people in your community can get access to reduced cost of care.Management of Cancers
During screening, if an individual is found to have a sign that could indicate cancer, a test called a biopsy would need to be taken done by a trained service provider. 
l	Treatment for cancer can be provided at the district hospital, in the medical college or in special centres created for treatment of cancer.
l	Treatment for cancer could be through surgery, medicines or radiotherapy (treatment using X-rays).

conditions. In this chapter, you will learn what tasks are expected of you in the screening, prevention and control of common NCDs. You will find that many points that have been highlighted are repeated here, but this will help you to understand and plan your day to day work. 
In order to provide community level care, you will continue to use Home Visits, the Village 
Health Nutrition Day (VHND), and meetings of Village Health Sanitation & Nutrition Committee (VHSNC). The main difference now is that your role will now expand to reach all adults of 30 years and above.
The ASHA facilitator and ANM will support you in household visits, conducting 
community health promotion activities, and follow up, particularly among those who are not regular with the treatment or are not making required lifestyle changes.Key Tasks of the ASHAChapter 6
Tasks of ASHA in prevention and control of  
Non-Communicable Diseases
1. Listing of all adults of 30 years and above. 
2. Completing the Community Based Assessment 
Checklist. 
3. Organising a screening day - understanding the work-flow processes.
4. Undertaking health promotion activity in the community. 
5. Undertaking follow up for treatment adherence and enabling lifestyle changes.
6. Creating Patient Support Groups.
1. Listing
So far you have made lists of pregnant women, new-borns, children, and eligible couples, so that you can ensure that they receive services that they require. For NCDs you will now also make lists of those women and men in your community who are of 30 years and above, so as to ensure that they are screened for NCDs and undertake follow up. You will continue to ensure that you reach the most marginalised as well as those who migrate into your area, so that they are also part of the screening and follow up process. 
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,50,"50   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable DiseasesYour first task is to list all women and men who are 30 years of age and above. Normally 
in a population of 1000 you will have about 370 people in this age group. (182 women and 188 men). This list is to be updated every 6 months. You will enter into your diary or health register the names, ages and sex of these individuals. (a format is attached at Annexure 1). Over time, these records will become available in an electronic format. You will be given a specific register or folder in which to record this information. The information is then to be given to the ANM who manages the sub centre of your area.
2. Completion of Community Based Assessment Checklist
Completion of Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC) for NCD screening through home visits. The next task is to complete a CBAC (Annexure 2) for all in this age category. This form is intended to capture information related to age, family history, waist circumference, and risky behaviours such as lack of physical activity, use of/or exposure to tobacco and alcohol. The CBAC also includes questions related to symptoms for cancer cervix, breast cancer, oral cancer, etc. The checklist will help you remember the key risk factors, identify those who must be prioritised to attend the screening camp and refer the individuals with symptoms to the nearest health facility where a Medical Officer is available.
When are completing the tool, please remember if a person responds, “yes” to any 
question in CBAC, it does not mean that they have the disease. Also, if somebody says 
“no” in response to a question it does not mean that they do not have the disease. The important thing for you to remember is that everybody (of 30 years and above) must be screened. You should also know that if an individual has a low score on the CBAC, this does not mean that they do not need screening. However, those with high risk scores on the CBAC should be strongly urged to get screened.
There is also a section in the form in which you must enter details of exposure to smoke 
which is not related to tobacco. This tells you about the risk of people to respiratory diseases.
You should also be careful to not create panic or scare in the community about these 
disease conditions. The checklist itself does not diagnose a patient with disease. You must

ASHA NCD Module-English,51,"Key Tasks of the ASHA   |   51explain to people, that they need to be first screened by the ANM and then the diagnosis 
will be confirmed by a medical officer. The key message is most NCDs are preventable and also that NCDs including cancer can be treated if detected early.
In completing the formats and CBAC, you will be asking individuals for Aadhaar numbers. 
Please note that every individual has to provide their consent to giving you the number. At Annexure 3, is a consent form that every individual must sign.
3. Screening
Screening is an activity where a person even though she/he is apparently healthy, is examined physically, or with the help of equipment or tests to identify if they have a disease condition. Individuals with Non-Communicable Diseases may appear healthy, so it is important to screen adults at regular intervals. This time period is different for different conditions. For hypertension and diabetes screening should be conducted every year, and for cancers once in five years. 
On a fixed day, every week, the ANM will undertake 
screening for hypertension, diabetes, oral and breast cancer. Until the ANMs are trained for detecting cancer of the cervix, screening for cancer cervix will take place at the PHC/CHC nearest the village. Depending on the distance the screening by ANMs can take place at the village or at the sub- centre. In urban areas, this can take place in the Urban PHC or outreach sessions. Screening involves examination of the mouth and the breast by the ANM, measurement of BP and glucose. 
T arget population (for screening):
l All men and women of 30 years and above for Oral cancer, Hypertension and Diabetes Mellitus.
l	 All women of 30 years and above for cervical and breast cancer.
Your tasks prior to the screening day are to mobilise the community to attend the screening on the date and time of the ANMs visit to the village or the date on which they need to go to the sub centre.
You should remember that most of the people will at first not agree to being examined, 
since they are healthy. You will need to use your skills to convince people that screening would help to identify disease conditions that may not have symptoms till the disease is advanced. If you find it difficult to convince any individual, you can ask the ASHA facilitator and ANM to visit the family along with you and explain the importance of screening.
On a particular day, about 30 people can be screened. Thus, in twelve or thirteen days 
you can screen the target population. These will be spread over the entire year. The ANM will make a schedule for screening in her area-and you will get the dates for your area from her. This also means that you will have to make sure that the number of people on a particular screening day, do not exceed thirty. Otherwise the ANM will be overburdened and crowd management will be difficult. You will also help the ANM in recording the 
"
ASHA NCD Module-English,52,"52   |   Module for ASHA on Non-Communicable Diseasesmeasurements. On every screening day, you also have to ensure that VHSNC and MAS 
members are also present and support you in undertaking health promotion activities. 
There are also likely to be people in your community who have already been diagnosed 
with one of these conditions. Their BP and glucose should be measured on a monthly basis and not necessarily on the screening day. 
4. Undertaking Health Promotion
In chapter 1, you have learnt about the importance of health promotion. You have also learnt about how to undertake health promotion related to specific risk behaviours. You have learnt how healthy lifestyles like diets, physical activity, and avoidance of tobacco and harmful drinking, etc ,can lead to prevention of diseases. You will need to make sure that health promotion activities are continuous and not limited to the screening day alone. You can also undertake health promotion during home visits and community meetings, including meetings of the VHSNC/MAS.
5. Undertaking Follow-up for T reatment Adherence and Enabling 
Lifestyle Changes
If an individual is referred by the ANM to the PHC-MO, you will need to follow up with 
them or even escort them to the health facility. Your task is to ensure that all individuals who are asked by the ANM to visit the health facility actually are examined by the MO. Some of them may be put on treatment for blood pressure or diabetes. Some may need to go to a CHC or district hospitals for confirmation of cancer. At Annexure four is a list of health care services for each condition that is available at the various levels of facility, including referral sites.
Once an individual is put on treatment for hypertension or diabetes the treatment is most 
likely lifelong. Your task is to make sure they obtain their supply of drugs from the sub centre or PHC, and are regular in taking the medicines. You will also need to undertake home visits to ensure that they are making changes in their life style and adopting positive health behaviours. This will reduce the likelihood of complications. 
Sometimes patients may complain of symptoms that could be a result of side effects of 
medicines. You must refer them to the MO in the PHCs. In the case of cancer patients, the treatment is at the level of a medical college or specialised cancer treatment centre. However, when the patient returns home you should follow up to provide support and enable referral in case of any symptoms. "
ASHA NCD Module-English,53,"Key Tasks of the ASHA   |   53
6. Creating Patient Support Groups 
As an ASHA, you should try to form groups of patients diagnosed with hypertension, 
diabetes and those on cancer treatment. Patients/friends/families/frontline workers can form these groups to help each other by bringing them together. Setting up and managing a patient support group does not require medical qualifications. All it needs is compassion, an ability to form groups conduct meetings and ensure that members are sensitive to each other’s needs.
Patient support groups help patients and their family members by providing mutual support, 
providing information about diseases, raising awareness about complications, countering discrimination and stigma attached to a particular disease and enabling support for treatment continuation and changes in lifestyle behaviour. As an ASHA, you should ensure that individuals who are part of marginalised groups and have a disease condition are also encouraged and supported to become part of these groups. You will speak at first to individual patient with a particular condition and tell them about the benefits of participating in such a group. Then you could even start with 2-3 individuals and their families/friends and enable regular meetings. Slowly people will join as word spreads.
As you complete your training in this book, you will have learnt a lot about these non- 
communicable diseases. You will have understood that all of them share several common features, particularly in relation to the modifiable risk factors - diet, physical activity, 
use of tobacco and alcohol. All of these can be addressed through 
health promotion efforts. Undertaking health promotion is a very 
important part of addressing non communicable diseases. There 
will be initial difficulties especially since it is hard to change 
behaviours, but with patience and practice you 
will become more confident in helping people. 
This will make you a trusted member of the community. Remember that you can always go 
to the ANM, nurse or medical officer in your 
PHC to clarify your doubts. "

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,1,"Introduction 1CHAPTEr 1
Introduction
The eye is one of the most important sensory organs which helps us to see everything around us. 
Those who cannot see, their quality of life and daily activities are greatly affected. 
There can be people in different age groups who can be blind. There can be children who can 
have blindness from birth. Today, these children can be helped with sufficient education and skill-based training. Blind children have grown up to become successful engineers, teachers and singers and are employed too. They can be educated in braille (system of reading and writing for the blind or who have low vision). 
The Ayushman Bharat programme includes Eye Care as part of Comprehensive Primary Health Care 
(CPHC) services to be provided at the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs). The broad goal of Eye Care is to let all people in the community have the best possible vision.
You, as an ASHA, are a very important team member in AB-HWCs and will play a crucial role in 
helping people maintain their normal eyesight and identifying those who have any eye problem. 
Eye Care, under this programme is delivered at different levels. Basic care is given at the 
community level, while the AB-HWCs can provide a little more care in both rural and urban areas. Most cases will require to be referred to the Community Health Officer (CHO)/Multi-Purpose Worker (MPW)/Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM)/Medical Officer (MO) available at the nearest AB-HWCs, Ophthalmic Assistant (OA) at Vision Centres (wherever available) and to Eye specialist/Eye doctor at the Community Health Centre (CHC)/Sub-District Hospital (SDH)/District Hospital (DH) or other higher health facilities for complete diagnosis and treatment.
You will work under the overall supervision of the CHO/MO heading the nearest AB-HWCs. They 
will monitor, support, and supervise you in delivery of eye care services to the community in your area. You will refer the community members with any eye-related problem to the nearest AB-HWC available in both rural and urban areas. Inform the MPW/ANM/CHO/MO 
available at  the 
nearest AB-HWCs regarding any visits to the health facility undertaken by any individual in your community for Eye Care to ensure regular follow-up of these individuals.  
In this

Senses in the human body
Our eyes enable us to see all the things 
around us like: people, animals, buildings, 
things in our home and where we workOur skin is sensitive to the touch. It 
helps us feel things like hot/cold, rough/
smooth etc.
Our nose enables us to smell things such 
as food cooking, fire burning, rain, polluted water
Our ears let us to hear sounds around us 
such as a baby crying, people talking, dogs 
barking, a car horn, water running, music 
playing
Our tongue enables us to taste if food 
and drink is sweet/sour, hot/cold, cooked/
uncooked etc.What are the five senses? What do we use them for?

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,3,"Understanding Our Eyes and Vision Testing 3Understanding Our Eyes and 
Vision TestingCHAPTEr 2
2.1 Structure of the Eye
The eye has many parts that must work together to produce clear vision. 
There are two parts to the eye – the front part which consists of the cornea, pupil, and lens; and 
the back part which has the sclera and the retina. All parts of the eye are very delicate, so it is 
important they remain well protected. 
The eyes are covered and protected by the eyelids and the eyelashes, which help protect from 
any injury and keep dirt, dust, particles and even harmful bright light out of the eye. 
The Human Eye consists of: 
Two !! eyelids in each eye - Upper and Lower.  
The !! cornea – central transparent dome like layer that covers the front of the eye. 
The !! pupil, or black 
circle at the centre 
of the eye, is an 
opening through which light can enter the eye.
The 
!! iris, or coloured 
part of the eye 
(people have black, 
brown, green or blue colour eyes). It controls how much 
light enters the eye 
by changing the size of the pupil.
Human Eye
"
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,4,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 4A clear !! lens is located behind the pupil. 
The !! sclera, or white part of the eye, protects the eyeball. 
The innermost circle inside the eye is !! retina.
Eyes are also protected by tears, which moisten them and clean out dirt, dust, and other irritants. 
Tears also help protect against infection in the eyes.
2.2 How do we see? 
The process of seeing is complex and works through brain and light. The rays from the object are 
focused through the cornea, enter the eye through pupil, then the lenses to reach finally into the 
back of eye, that is the retina. From here, signals are sent to a special nerve called optic nerve 
and that helps in forming the images that we see. If any part of this vision process is damaged, then the person will have a difficulty in seeing properly. 
Human beings have two eyes. We see differently with one eye than we can see using both the 
two eyes. Seeing from both the eyes helps us in getting the overall real picture of the objects.
2.3 Checking the Eyesight to identify people with poor vision (blindness 
and low vision) in the community
You will use finger counting method and 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart) at the community 
level. 
A. How do I find someone has blindness by finger counting method?
You will undertake the finger counting method to check for blindness in all 
community members in population aged 
above 18 years.
Instructions 
1. Stand 3 meters (10 feet) away from the person.
2. If the person wears spectacles/glasses for seeing distant (far) vision, ask the person to wear them during 
the test. 
How do we see
Finger Counting Method"
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,5,"Understanding Our Eyes and Vision Testing 53. Ask the person to close their one eye with the palm of their hand. If left eye is closed, 
cover the eye properly with palm of the left hand and vice-versa. 
4. You hold up any number of your fingers (one, two, three, four or five in any order).
5.  Ask the person to tell you how many fingers she/he can see.
6. To be sure, do the test again showing a different number of fingers this time. Again ask the person to tell you how many fingers she/he can see.
7. Repeat this test 2-3 times to be sure about the test for each eye. 
8. This test is done for both eyes separately.
Maintain records of all those community members who cannot count fingers at 3 meters in your community with the eyes such as writing their name, age, result of finger count test separately for both eyes – right eye (R/E) and left eye (L/E). Such individuals are suffering from blindness 
and should be referred for further testing by CHO/MPW/MO 
available at  the nearest AB-HWC. In 
such individuals, activities of daily living will be affected as they suffer from blindness. Maintain their records in a separate register and prepare a list of referrals and ensure follow-up of these 
individuals.
Individuals who can count fingers at 3 meters (10 feet) with one eye or both the eyes, should then 
be tested for distant vision using 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart).
B. How do I use 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart) for recording distant vision 
of people?
A quick method to determine if distant 
vision is poor or is lost in any eye is 
the 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart). 
You will undertake screening of visual impairment using 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart) at community level of 
all adult community members aged 
above 18 years, who are able to count fingers by finger counting method.
This E chart can be used in schools for vision screening of school children. Under the Rashtriya 
Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), all children and adolescents (0-18 years) are screened for eye and vision related problems at school and Anganwadi levels by the RBSK Mobile Health Team. 
Ensure the eye is properly covered by the children with the palms of their hands while testing for 
vision related problems.

Find a space that is properly lit (not too dark, not too bright or looking into the sun). !!
Measure the distance – 6 meters (20 feet). Take six steps from the tree or wall. Mark the 
spot. Attach the screening card/chart to a wall or a tree. Ensure the test is undertaken 
after measuring the required distance of 6 meters (20 feet). 
Make the individual stand/sit comfortably. !!
Explain to the individual what you are going to do. !!
Steps to be undertaken by you
First show the vision chart !!
close to the person. You will 
explain that you will point at 
one of the Es  and they should 
answer where the ‘arms’ point to (left direction, downward direction, right direction and  
upward direction). 
Make sure that the person 
!!
understands by asking them 
to indicate the direction of 
the arms. 
If the person normally wears !!
spectacles/glasses to see in 
the distance, tell them to wear 
their glasses during the test. 
Measure 6 meters (20 feet) from the person, using the prepared 6 meter string or tape !!
measure. The 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart) should be at the same level as the person’s 
eyes.
Ask the person to cover their left eye properly with the palm of their left hand, so that you !!
can test the right eye. 
Stand beside the vision chart and point to one of the Es. Ask the person to point with a !!
finger which direction the mouth of the E is facing. Repeat with the other Es.If the person does not indicate the correct direction, move to the next E and ask them to 
!!
point again. 
Now ask the person to cover the right eye properly with the !! palm of their right hand  and repeat 
the test with the left eye. Undertake the same steps as given above with all the 4 Es. 
Individuals who cannot indicate the correct direction for 3 out of the 4 Es from one eye or !!
both the eyes are visually impaired. Maintain records of all the community members. 
Refer the individuals from the community who cannot read 3 out of the 4 Es to the CHO/!!
MPW/MO available at the nearest AB-HWC for further assessment. Maintain a list of 
referrals and ensure follow-up of these individuals. 
You can take the help of CHO/MPW/ANM at AB-HWCs for using this chart and identifying people 
with visual impairment.

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,7,"Understanding Our Eyes and Vision Testing 72.4 Tool for assessing vision problems
You are aware about the Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC). You have used it for 
assessing risk factors for common Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). As part of this CBAC, 
you would additionally ask questions related to vision. You will administer the CBAC to target 
individuals like before. The questions related to vision are as follows:
Cloudy or blurred vision - Yes/No
Difficulty in reading - Yes/No
Pain in eyes lasting for more than a week - Yes/No
Redness in eyes lasting for more than a week - Yes/No
The purpose of CBAC is to help in early detection of individuals with vision problems. You 
should also be careful to not create panic or scare in the community for anyone having visual problems. The checklist itself does not diagnose a patient with disease. The CBAC is provided 
as Annexure-3. 
In case, the individual answers ‘Yes’ to any one of the questions given above in the CBAC, you 
must refer the individual immediately to the nearest AB-HWC.
In addition to CBAC, as discussed above, you will undertake screening for blindness using finger 
counting method and visual impairment using 6/18 Snellen vision chart (E chart). In both these screening methods, individuals who cannot see or read from any one or both the eyes will be 
referred for further screening by CHO/MPW/MO available at the nearest AB-HWC for cataract or 
other eye conditions.
rEMEMBEr
Questions included in CBAC related to vision are only for screening and not for !
diagnosis.
Diagnosis for visual problems would be confirmed by Ophthalmic Assistant/Medical !
Officer/Eye Specialist /Eye Doctor.
Please Note: During your home visits, keep a record of individuals who complain of any 
difficulty in threading the needle or cleaning the food grains. These individuals will need to be 
referred to Ophthalmic Assistant at Vision Centre/Ophthalmologist (Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist) 
at higher health facilities for use of near vision glasses. 
Any patient complaining of sudden loss of vision in one or both the eyes (with or without 
pain in any eye) should be urgently sent to the nearest referral eye centre for further 
management."

Problems at Community LevelCHAPTEr 3
3.1 Cataract
Cataract is one of the major reasons for blindness in 
India. It is also called as ‘Safed Motia’ in Hindi, other 
regions will also have a local term for it. Largely, adults aged more than 50 years, can be affected by it which means it is an age-related condition which occurs due to the ageing process. Sometimes, people who 
are younger may also develop cataract; this can also 
occur in children at birth.
It affects lens of the eye that helps in normal vision 
of an individual. Cataract can also occur due to other 
conditions like Diabetes Mellitus (DM) in adults, or after 
an eye injury, inflammation, or long-term steroid use.
3.1.1 How do we identify Cataract in a 
person? 
Let us compare the photograph of two eyes shown. 
What do you notice? 
The normal eye has a central black hole and 
people are able to see properly because light rays can enter through it normally. In the 
second eye in the photograph, you will notice 
that black hole is replaced with white or greyish colour. Due to this, light rays will not be able to enter normally and thus people having this 
kind of situation will have their vision affected. 
This condition is called ‘Cataract’ and it affects mainly the lens of the eye.

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,9,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 9You have already been listing all adults (women and men) for Non-Communicable Diseases . You 
will continue to maintain this list for all target population so as to ensure that they are screened 
for visual impairment and undertake follow-up. You will continue to ensure that you reach the 
most marginalised population as well as those who migrate into your area, so that they are also part of the screening and follow-up process. The list is to be updated every six months. You will enter the details in the reporting format provided by the 
State/UT.  
As mentioned earlier, you will complete the CBAC for adults which also includes questions regarding Eye Care. If there is any ‘yes’ response to any of the symptoms related to eye, you will refer the individual immediately to the nearest AB-HWC. Pay special attention to those who have problems in seeing normally from a distance or in whom you can see the central black hole with 
white or greyish colour. 
3.1.2 Symptoms of Cataract 
1. There is gradual loss of vision from the affected eye. Without treatment it will deteriorate/
worsen further.
2. The person may complain of hazy (cloudy/blurred) vision as if there was something over their eyes.
3. The person may complain that he/she has to change his/her spectacles/glasses very frequently but are still not able to see clearly with the use of spectacles/glasses. 
4. The person may also complain that he/she finds it difficult to tolerate bright light or glare (strong light).
3.1.3 Treatment of Cataract
Any person who has cataract in any eye will have to undergo an operation or a procedure  
in a hospital where eye surgeries are done. There is no other treatment for this condition.  
During this operation, they will remove the damaged lens and replace it with a new  
artificial lens. You should also know that adult persons with diabetes are more likely to develop early Cataract. 
Such persons should get their annual eye examination done by an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist. 
Also, look for children whose families have complained of their child having poor vision and 
coordinate with the RBSK team for further management. "

3.1.5 Messages for the Community
A. Preparation before Cataract surgery
1. The patient must be checked by the doctor to determine which eye has the cataract. 
2. Before surgery is done, simple investigations like blood pressure measurement, blood sugar, 
urine examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) is done and advice about date of surgery and general precautions will be explained to the affected person. 
3. Some persons delay their operation. It is important to note that delaying the surgery may increase the chance of complications after the surgery. So, it is better to get operated early 
and avoid any complications.
4. The person undergoing cataract surgery must understand that proper rest will be required 
after the surgery, and that there should not be any exposure to dust, smoke or pollution. 
5. Any person with cough or other problems must first get that treated before getting a cataract 
surgery. 
B. Post-surgery information
1. The operated eye should 
be protected with an eye 
shield. 
2. The operated eye should be protected from bright 
light, TV screen, mobile, computer, dust, smoke, 
smoke from chullas and 
jerks (quick, sharp, sudden movement) for time period as suggested by the doctor. Need for using protective eye wear such as dark eyeglasses during daytime will be advised by the doctor.  1. It is normally seen in elderly people and is a result of ageing. However, it can also occur 
in younger age groups and in children. Adult persons with diabetes are more likely to 
develop Cataract at an early age.
2. It cannot be cured by putting any eye drops/eye ointment. Cataract can be cured ONLY 
with eye surgery. 
3. The eye procedure commonly involves taking out the affected lens from the eye and replacing it with a new artificial lens so that vision can be restored to normal.
4. This procedure for correction of cataract is safe and commonly done, but only in a recognised hospital by an 
Eye Specialist/Eye Doctor.  It cannot be done in the Community or 
at AB-HWCs.
5. Under the National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment, government Eye Hospitals and Non-Governmental Organisations provide free cataract surgeries to affected people.
6. In adults, who have cataract due to ageing, both eyes may be affected and treatment may be required for both the eyes.

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,11,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 113. The Eye Doctor will advise the patients for putting eye drops/eye ointment in the operated 
eye. These should be done correctly for the period prescribed. Refer to Annexure-1 and 
Annexure-2 for correct steps to administer eye drops and eye ointment, respectively. 
4. The patient should not rub the operated eye.
5. The patient should not put water into the operated eye but should maintain hygiene around 
the eye by cleaning it. The area around the eye can be cleaned by using cotton. Take a bowl of water and cotton, boil the water and let it cool. Now, cotton can be used to put water around 
the eye. This can be done every morning by the patient for at least 10 days after the surgery.
6. Avoid having a head bath for at least 5 days after cataract surgery. 
7. The patient should not sleep on the same side as the operated eye at least for one week. 
8. Avoid lifting heavy objects, doing exercises for 4-6 weeks and avoid applying kajal/any eye make-up for at least 4 weeks.
9. Normal balanced diet should be taken by the patient after the surgery.
10. After the cataract surgery is done, it is important for the patient to visit and consult eye doctor 
after one week of operation and then after one month of operation. 
11. If there are any complaints in the operated eye like redness, pain or poor vision, the patient 
should contact the eye surgeon/eye doctor immediately.
12. Patients after the cataract surgery may require spectacles depending on the type of lens used in the eye. 
Common Myths and Facts about Cataract 
1. MYTH: Cataract can be treated with eye drops.
 FACT: Only surgery can treat cataract.
2. MYTH: Cataract surgery is dangerous.
 FACT:  It is one of the safest operations.
3. MYTH: It can take a long time to recover after cataract surgery.
 FACT: Most of the patients resume normal activity and restore their vision within one week-
one month time period.
4. MYTH: Cataract is reversible.
 FACT: No. Once the cataract occurs, it is not reversible and it will progress to further reduce 
vision. 
5. MYTH: Cataract surgery can be done only in winter season.
 FACT:  Cataract surgery can be done in any season. Any individual who has undergone cataract operation in one eye, must be counselled to not 
neglect the other eye. Ensure the individual pays attention to the other eye to avoid any 
complications. Refer the individuals to the nearest AB-HWC for regular check-up of both the 
eyes."
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,12,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 123.1.6 r ole of ASHA in management of Cataract
1. Make a line list of all those individuals whom you have identified with poor vision (blindness 
and low vision) by using the finger counting method or Snellen 6/18 E-Chart or high-risk 
individuals found after filling CBAC form. Refer them to the nearest AB-HWC for screening for 
cataract and further management. 
2. During your home visits, take a note of any child or individual in whom you/parents/caregiver 
notice that the central black hole is replaced with white or yellow/greyish colour in one or both 
the eyes. Refer these suspected individuals to the nearest referral centre for examination. Report any child with vision problems to the RBSK team.
3. Follow-up the suspected/high-risk person during your household visits to see whether the person has got himself/herself investigated/examined. Follow up with children and ensure proper treatment through RBSK team. 
4. Ensure that the individual goes for cataract surgery on the appointed date and follow up the status after surgery.
5. After the surgery, you should make home visits and monitor that the patient is putting eye 
drops or eye ointment correctly. Refer to Annexure-1 and Annexure-2, respectively. 
6. Remind the patient to visit the Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist after one week and one month after the surgery or as advised by the doctor.
7. Educate the community about the need to get eye screening done every year for the adult population and those who have problems seeing clearly. Mobilise families of children and 
adolescents (0-18 years) for regular screening of eye by RBSK team. 
3.2 Refractive Errors, Squint and Presbyopia
Refractive errors (Drishti Dosh) occur when light rays do not fall and focus properly to the back of eyes, that is on the retina. It is the commonest eye problem and affects all age groups. Uncorrected 
refractive errors also are one of the commonest causes of visual impairment (low vision problems) 
in India.
3.2.1 Symptoms of r efractive Errors
The common symptoms of Refractive Errors are:
1. Diminished (poor) vision and difficulties in seeing distant objects or near objects
2. Tiredness and watering of eyes
3. Headache/eye ache or eye pain
4. Frequent blinking/squeezing eyelids or rubbing of eyes
5. Recurrent formation of stye in the eye
6. Frequent itching of the eye
7. Eyelid swelling
8. Some children may have squint (cross eyes) "
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,13,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 133.2.2 Diagnosis of r efractive Errors
At the community level, you will mobilise the community to visit the nearest AB-HWC after 
screening for blindness and visual impairment. The health worker at the AB-HWC will screen 
for visual acuity by using Snellen’s Chart and near vision chart of adult community members. 
The individuals with vision problems after screening at AB-HWCs will be referred to Vision Centres (where Ophthalmic Assistant is available) or to the Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist at CHC/SDH/DH/higher health facilities for complete testing and confirmation of Refractive Errors. Once 
diagnosed, the Ophthalmic Assistant (OA)/Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist will advise about use of 
spectacles and arrange for spectacles for the patient.
3.2.3 Correction of r efractive Errors
Refractive errors can be treated and are commonly corrected by spectacles. Regular eye examination and measuring vision can detect the presence of refractive errors in eye and can be 
corrected easily. The refractive errors can be detected at government facilities by an Ophthalmic 
Assistant or Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist and the power of spectacles can be prescribed by them. 
3.2.4 Are there any other methods of correction of r efractive Errors, other 
than spectacles?
Yes, there are other methods too, like laser surgery and lenses. But the treating Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist only prescribes the best option available. Spectacles remain the best option available.
3.2.5 r efractive 
Errors in children
Refractive errors also occur in children. 
The common signals 
in children that can indicate presence of refractive errors in 
children and will call 
for eye examination by an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist/Ophthalmic 
Assistant are: 
1. One eye moves or aims in a different direction than the other.
2. The child blinks or rubs his/her eyes excessively while watching TV or reading.
3. The child hits into things or drops things.
4. The child holds reading material or objects too close, turns head to focus.
5. The child frequently complains of headaches, eyestrain, double vision or blurring of vision.
6. The child has watering of eyes.
7. The child is not able to read the blackboard from back benches of the classroom.
8. The child less than one year of age does not follow light or objects.

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,14,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 14Eyesight of children and adults should be checked as follows in nearby health facility where an 
Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist/Ophthalmic Assistant is available:
1. When the child starts going to school at entry level. After that, once in every year.
2. For children wearing spectacles, once every six months.
3. For adults: When they turn 40 years, especially for near vision.
3.2.6 Squint 
In this condition, both the eyes look in different directions, also referred as 
‘crossed eyes’. This is usually seen in 
children, in early years of their life. So, when a child looks at an object, both eyes will align differently. In most cases, the 
child will only use one eye at a time, thus 
straining that eye, and losing the benefits of both eyes. 
The condition in most of the cases can be 
noticed by parents/caregivers. This situation can be corrected, if detected early and 
timely treatment is provided. If you get to 
know of such a history in your service area during your home visits or are informed by parents/caregivers that their child has problem in vision and complains of cross eyes, you 
should refer the child at the earliest to the nearest  AB-HWC and coordinate with the RBSK team 
for further management. Such children will require a detailed eye examination. In case of adults with squint, you must inform the CHO/MPW/Medical Officer available at the nearest AB-HWC for further check-up and management. 
3.2.7 Presbyopia
This is a condition that is age related and occurs in almost everybody by the age of  
40 years. It occurs because with old age there is degenerative changes (loss of function) in the eyes and the eyes lose 
the ability to accommodate (focus on near 
objects). In this case, the person is not able to view near objects properly and finds difficulty in reading. Other activities 
requiring near vision are also affected such 
as: sorting rice and pulses/or food grains, threading the needle, reading small print on medicines, seeing the text in mobile 
phones, etc.
Presbyopia can be corrected by use of spectacles easily. There are readymade glasses with 
necessary correction for near vision. This can be easily detected and guided by the Ophthalmic 
Assistant or an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist.

If any adult or child is suspected to have refractive errors, squint or presbyopia, you must inform the 
CHO/MPW/Medical Officer available at the nearest AB-HWC. They will further refer the person to 
nearby health facility where an Ophthalmic Assistant or an Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist is available. 
Inform and coordinate with the RBSK team for further management of the suspected child. 
Undertake the following activities:
1. If there is a need for the person to wear spectacles and they are not convinced, you must 
explain the importance and emphasize that correcting their eye problem is very important before it gets worse. 
2. As an ASHA, see that children, young girls and women in your community who have refractive errors of any type, should be referred to the nearest AB-HWC. Ensure that when 
spectacles are prescribed, they should regularly wear them.
3. Ask if the patient is having any difficulty in using the spectacles/glasses and encourage the 
regular use of wearing the spectacles prescribed by the OA/Eye Doctor/Eye Specialist. 
4. Ask the person to visit the nearest AB-HWC in case of symptoms such as continued redness, watering, eye fatigue, diminished vision following the use of spectacles.
5. Counsel the individuals on the importance of consumption of Vitamin A rich foods (given in section on Vitamin A deficiency) and limit the use of television/mobile phones, computer and other electronic items that can cause strain to the eyes as much as possible. 
6. Encourage the community to perform simple eye exercises to reduce eyestrain (20-20-20 rule): Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.
3.3 Conjunctivitis
It is also commonly known as ‘Eye Flu’. It occurs more towards the end of summer and beginning 
of monsoon season and is contagious in nature 
(it spreads from one person to another). It often affects both eyes and begins with an itchy sensation in the eyes. This is followed by redness 
in eyes, and then stickiness of eyelashes and 
swelling of the eyes.
There is collection of white-yellowish discharge. 
Normally, it gets corrected on its own within 
3-4 days without any medicine and with hygienic measures. If the redness/pain still remains 
beyond 3-4 days, refer the individual to the 
nearest AB-HWC for further management.
remember - Not every r ed Eye is Conjunctivitis. 
3.3.1 How it spreads
The fingers, flies, fomites (handkerchief, bath towel, bed sheets/bed covers/pillows, etc.) spread 
the infection. The transmission from person to person can be reduced by avoiding the sharing of 
personal things.

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,16,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 163.3.2 Prevention of Conjunctivitis
Most important part is to maintain adequate hygiene. 
Some important points include:
1. Frequent washing of hands and face with clean water.
2. Keep separate towel, handkerchief, bed cloth, etc. for every family member.
3. Daily wash the personal belongings like listed 
above with clean water.
4. Avoid touching the eyes frequently.
5. Use of sunglasses and avoid dusty, sunny places.
6. Avoid the use of kajal and surma during an episode of conjunctivitis.
7. Avoid over-crowded places to reduce spread to others.
3.3.3 Treatment of Conjunctivitis
People who have conjunctivitis should be counselled for the following: 
1. Frequently wash the eyes with clean cold water.
2. Place a cold, damp clean cloth on eye to give a soothing effect.
3. Avoid self-medication and do not use medicines without medical advice.
4. Frequent antibiotic eye drops in daytime and antibiotic eye ointment in night-time are usually needed for the treatment. 
5. Do not put ghee/honey/rose water/onion extract in the eyes.
6. Tell them to inform you and consult the CHO/MPW/Medical Officer available at the nearest 
AB-HWC if condition does not improve within 3-4 days.
3.3.4 r ole of the ASHA in management of Conjunctivitis
1. Identify all cases of conjunctivitis and immediately refer them to the nearest AB-HWC for further management. 
2. Follow up all cases to see that they are taking their treatment and maintaining proper hygiene.
3. Make sure that all other family members also maintain strict hygiene and are not in direct contact with the patient. 
4. Educate communities about occurrence of conjunctivitis and its prevention measures.
3.4 Vitamin A Deficiency
You must be aware that Vitamin A solution is given to children. The mother and child protection (MCP) card 
helps in keeping a record of Vitamin A doses given 
to children. Currently, as per National Immunization Schedule, a child receives nine doses of Vitamin A starting from 9 months of age and then every  
6 months, till the child attains the age of five years.

"
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,17,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 173.4.1 Have you ever thought why Vitamin A is given to children? What are its 
functions?
Vitamin A is one of the micronutrients required by our body. One of its functions is that to help 
in normal eyesight. Its deficiency occurs most often in children less than five years and also in 
pregnant women. It is seen especially in poor families and malnourished children/Severe Acute 
Malnutrition (SAM) children, children with diarrhoea and children with measles. It is also seen in situations of natural disasters like floods, drought, earthquake, etc. when there is a problem in availability of food and people are not available to have adequate diet that leads to diet deficient 
in intake of Vitamin A. 
Deficiency of Vitamin A can be present in 
many ways, one of which is loss of night 
vision. This is called Night Blindness and 
is the first eye sign of Vitamin A deficiency. In this condition, persons are not able to 
see properly when it is dark. Mothers/
caregivers can complain that their child falls when it is a little dark time as they do not see objects. If it is not treated, it can 
progress to affect the whole eye which will 
lead to dryness of eyes and cornea and finally to blindness.
You can also visually see some dirty white 
patch on outer side of the eye as seen in the 
picture, called as Bitot’s Spot in individuals with Vitamin A deficiency. 
Bitot’s Spot once formed cannot be removed by Vitamin A treatment.
3.4.2 Food sources of Vitamin A 
Regular consumption of vitamin A rich foods such as milk and milk products, butter, ghee; 
whole egg, liver, meat, chicken, fish; dark green leafy vegetables like Amaranthus leaves 
(cholai), drumstick leaves, methi (fenugreek) leaves, spinach (palak), mustard leaves (sarson 
saag), turnip leaves, coriander, radish leaves, bathua leaves, mint leaves; yellow and orange vegetables and fruits like carrots, tomato, sweet potato (shakarkandi), papaya, mango, apricots (khoomani), dates, etc. and appropriate breastfeeding (colostrum is rich in Vitamin A). Home 
garden/community garden to grow vitamin rich vegetables and fruits should be encouraged, 
wherever applicable. Bitot’s Spot

Vitamin A rich foods"
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,18,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 183.4.3 Prevention of Vitamin A related eye problems
Prevention of Vitamin A deficiency includes giving at least nine doses of vitamin A to all children 
aged 9 to 59 months. The first dose of 100,000 International Unit (IU) is administered with measles 
vaccination at 9 months and subsequent doses of 200,000 IU each, every six months till 5 years 
of age. 
However, in all cases that already have signs of Vitamin A blindness, they will need higher doses 
of Vitamin A and more frequently. All persons can be treated at the nearest AB-HWC by CHO/
MPW and complicated cases may be treated by the Medical Officer.
Due to the Vitamin A supplementation programme, Vitamin A deficiency has become rare in the 
country.
3.4.4 r ole of the ASHA in prevention of Vitamin A deficiency disorders 
1. Educating and creating awareness among mother/caregiver especially among the vulnerable 
section of the population regarding:
signs, symptoms of Vitamin A deficiency in children and also in pregnant women;!!
prevention by consumption of locally available, seasonal Vitamin A rich foods;!!
Vitamin A supplementation for children 9-59 months of age;!!
encouraging breastfeeding focusing on colostrum feeding.!!
Home visits, health campaigns, community platforms like Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Day (VHSND) session, Urban Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Day (UHSND) session, 
Village Health, Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC), Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS), 
Anganwadi centres, etc. all maybe used for awareness generation on prevention of Vitamin A deficiency disorders. 
2. Ensuring all children less than five years to receive age-appropriate doses of Vitamin A prophylaxis from nearest AB-HWC/immunization outreach sessions.
3. Monitoring all measles cases in children and ensuring that they receive Vitamin A supplementation. 
4.  Referring all cases of night blindness or other signs of Vitamin A deficiency to the nearest AB-HWC for confirmation and treatment.

May also be !! blurred vision if thick pus from within the stye spreads over the eye's surface
Presence of a lump (like a pimple) on the edge of the eyelid!!
Redness and painful swelling of the skin !!
May be thick discharge on the lids and lashes!!
Tears can also be produced in response to irritation!!
3.5.4 Treatment for Stye
The most traditional treatment is application of frequent, dry, warm (not too hot) compresses 
several times a day. If there is severe burning, discharge and redness that interferes with vision, 
refer to the nearest AB-HWC for treatment. 
Eye drops will be advised by the medical doctor and some cases, may also require surgical 
removal of the pus by an Eye Specialist/Eye Doctor. There is no role of oral antibiotics in treatment of Stye. 
3.5.5 Prevention of Stye
1. The most effective method of prevention is to keep the eyelids and eyelashes clean. 
2. Dry and warm compresses on a daily basis on the stye at the first sign of irritation in the eyelid can prevent it from getting worse. 
3. Following general eye health and hygienic measures. 
4. In children with styes, closely follow-up as it can spread fast and become dangerous. 
5. If there is formation of recurrent styes in individuals, refer them to the nearest AB-HWC to 
check for Diabetes Mellitus and/or Refractive Errors.  
3.6 Trachoma
Trachoma is an infectious disease which spreads from one person to an another person. It mainly 
affects the eyelids and children can easily get the disease. In adults (after 15 years of age), because 
of repeated infections earlier in life, the eyelashes can turn inwards and can rub against the front 
part of the eye resulting in cloudiness, that in turn, leads to blindness.
3.6.1 How is disease transmitted and how can we prevent its spread? 
The disease is transmitted by flies and through close physical contact like while playing, sharing bed with infected person, mothers of infected children, sharing towels, pillows and handkerchiefs. 
Overcrowding, poor hygienic conditions, stagnant water, inadequate use of latrines, practice of 
open defecation to which flies are attracted are other risk factors for this disease. 
Trachoma is also referred as ‘water washed’ disease because frequent washing of faces and 
good personal hygiene will prevent people from getting this disease. "
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,20,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 203.6.2 Identifying children with trachoma
Signs and Symptoms 
1. Pain in eyes on blinking
2. Redness and irritation in eyes
3. Foreign body sensation in eyes
4. Continuous tearing (watering)

5. Increased sensitivity to bright light
6. Appearance of nodules on the inner surface of eyelids (usually 
upper eyelid)
In adults, the inward turning of eyelashes in an individual can be checked through torch 
examination of the eye by the MPW/CHO/MO.
3.6.3 r ole of the ASHA in prevention of Trachoma 
1. Promoting face hygiene among community members by regular bathing and face washing. Teach and promote the steps of regular hand washing with soap and clean water. 
2. Promoting use of latrines and educating community members about the harms related to open defecation.
3. Referring persons with eyelashes turned inwards to the nearest AB-HWC. 
4. Spreading the following messages amongst the community members:
a. Keep your environment clean. 
b. Remove all fly breeding situations in and around the home.
c. Maintain personal hygiene. Wash your face with clean water several times in a day.
d. Keep separate towel, linens etc. for each member of family and keep them clean. 
3.7 Glaucoma
It is also called as ‘Kala Motia’ in Hindi. This is known as ‘silent thief’ of vision. There are two 
types of glaucoma – painless and painful. The condition is caused due to an increase in pressure 
inside the eye.
The painless glaucoma is detected late, and vision is lost in most cases. Whatever vision is lost, 
cannot be restored, resulting in blindness.
The painful glaucoma presents with sudden severe pain and redness in any one of the eyes, 
headache along with loss/dimness of vision. The pain may be so severe as to cause nausea or vomiting. The patient should immediately be referred to the nearest AB-HWC.Nodules on the inner surface of upper eyelid

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,21,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 213.7.1 risk factors for Glaucoma
1. Age more than 40 years (sometimes it can also occur in children). 
2. History of diabetes, blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease, high lipids/cholesterol.
3. Family history of glaucoma.
3.7.2 Let us see these photographs below. What do you observe?
The first picture is what a person with normal vision can see. The other two are from patients with 
glaucoma. In early stages, only the side vision gets damaged. If not treated, this becomes worse 
and finally the person can only see the middle part of the picture. 
Note: Individuals having tunnel vision (seen in the second and third picture) in glaucoma, may still 
have normal vision and can still read the last line in the Snellen Chart. Therefore, individuals with 
any of the risk factors given above, should be advised for regular check-up for glaucoma once a year at the nearest AB-HWC.
3.7.3 Signs and symptoms of Glaucoma
1. Coloured bright circles around source of light.
2. Headache and severe eye pain.
3. Gradual loss of side vision and restriction of field of vision as explained above.
4. Frequent change of spectacles.
3.7.4 Treatment of Glaucoma 
Any person complaining of eye pain and with blood pressure (hypertension), diabetes, heart disease or high lipids/cholesterol should be checked for glaucoma. These individuals must go 
once a year for eye examination. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults. You 
must refer them to the nearest AB-HWC. Persons detected with glaucoma will be suggested eye surgery/medical treatment by an Eye Specialist/Eye Doctor available at higher referral centres.
3.7.5 r ole of ASHA in prevention of Glaucoma
1. Educating community members about signs and symptoms of glaucoma.
2. Ensure people with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease or high lipids/cholesterol visit the nearest AB-HWC for screening to see if they can see full picture or not. Such individuals Source: Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic SciencesNormal Vision Early onset of Glaucoma Glaucoma

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,22,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 22and their family members should get their eye pressure checked and eye examination at 
least once in a year.
3. Ensure that persons reporting symptoms suggestive of glaucoma, should be referred for examination by the CHO/Medical Officer heading the nearest AB-HWC, who may refer them to higher facilities for detailed eye check-up.  Remember, early detection and regular treatment 
can prevent blindness due to glaucoma. 
4. Educate the community members that eye drops prescribed by a medical doctor for glaucoma need to be continued life-long, like taking medications for life in conditions like Diabetes and 
Hypertension. 
5. Regular follow- up of all diagnosed glaucoma cases to monitor that they are putting their eye 
drops regularly. 
3.8 Eye Injuries
There are different situations where someone can have an Eye injury. Some of the direct causes 
are:
1. Chemical colours falling into the eyes while playing Holi.
2. During a physical fight or playing outdoor games. 
3. Hot water burning the eyes or Diwali crackers falling into the eye.  
4. Sharp objects or grain husks/small sticks going into the eye during some physical work, e.g., cutting wood, farming season. 
5. Ultraviolet light entering the eye when a welder does work without eye protection. 
6. Looking directly at the sun during a Solar Eclipse. 
Damage to the eye due to injuries are preventable if adequate precautions are taken. These can 
happen without any warning. Eye injuries can be minor or serious and can lead to permanent 
blindness also. 
3.8.1 Provide important messages for community members to prevent Eye 
Injuries
A. At Home 
1. Keep sharp objects at home away from children. Some objects like pencils, knife, scissors, 
sharp edged toys should be handled with care particularly by children.
2. Keep hot liquids out of the reach of children. Do not leave boiling utensils on reachable surfaces of children.
3. Switch off iron after use or leave at a safe place out of reach of children. 
4. While using sprays, care should be observed that nozzles/opening are directed away from users, while pressing down the handle.
5. Chemicals at home including detergents and ammonia, etc. should be handled with care. Hands should be washed after their use. 
6. Keep all pesticides, fungicides, phenyl, acids and alcohol under lock and key. "

1. It is important to supervise children while they are playing with toys or games that can be 
harmful. Many toys have pointed or sharp ends and games like gilli-danda and boxing can 
be dangerous for eyes.
2. Toys like dart (sharp pointed objects), toy guns, etc. can hit the eyes from the distance. 
These should be avoided.
C. During Festivals
1. Adult supervision is vital while children play during festival.
2. Do not give crackers to children.
3. Do not light fireworks indoor.
4. Eyeglasses or goggles should be worn for protection.
5. Place a bucket of water nearby to put out fire.
6. During Holi, herbal colours should be used. Chemicals should be avoided.
3.8.2 When something falls in the eye (foreign body in the eye)
Foreign bodies can enter the eyes during harvesting season, particles from cutting 
wood, while travelling on high-speed 
vehicles, etc. Small particles of charcoal, wood, sand, small sticks of plants, etc. can also enter and settle in the eye. This 
will lead to irritation in the eyes and can 
damage the eyesight. 
If something falls in the eye, following 
points need to be observed:
1. Tell the person not to panic. The 
person should sit quietly and 
asked not to rub the eyes. The person should not try to remove the foreign body from the eye. 
2. It is important to wash eyes with plenty of water.
3. Let the tears wash it away. Most of the time, tears will do the cleaning.
4. Do not put any medicines or traditional eye medicines or any home remedies like ghee, 
honey, rose water, onion extract into eyes. They are harmful.
5. Do not bandage, just cover the injured eye with a clean cloth and do not put any pressure 
on the injured eye. Refer the individual to the nearest AB-HWC for removal of foreign 
body or stabilisation to the eye. These individuals may then be referred to higher facilities 
if required. 
3.8.3 r ole of the ASHA in preventing Eye Injuries 
1. Raise awareness among community members about prevention of eye injuries at home, in the community and during festivals.Foreign body in the eye

"
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,24,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 242. Do first aid for all eye injury cases – washing the eyes and keeping them covered with a clean 
cloth.
3. Refer the individual immediately to the nearest AB-HWC for management. These individuals may also be referred to higher facilities, as required. 
4. Follow up on all cases after treatment. 
5. Supervise special festivals where eye injuries are common such as Holi and Diwali. 
6. Promote use of protective eyeglasses for farmers, those doing mechanical or welding work, use of helmets covered with front glass for those driving two-wheelers, educating 
community members to not look directly at the sun during Solar Eclipse, etc. The flying husk/
small sticks of plants/any foreign body can enter the eye and lead to ulcers in the cornea and to blindness.
3.9 Special situations for Eye Care
3.9.1 Diabetes and Eye Diseases
As an ASHA, you are mobilising the community members for screening for diabetes to the nearest AB-HWC as part of NCD screening programme. It is important to ensure that all 
confirmed cases of diabetes get an eye check-up done once a year even if they do not have 
any eye complaints. 
The problem of diabetes is increasing in our country and so are its long-term effects. As you know, 
in diabetes, the blood glucose levels are increased. It can be controlled by taking medicines that 
are available now at the AB-HWCs. 
Diabetes affects many organs and one of them is the eyes. It affects mainly the back lining of 
the eye called the retina. It can also result in early cataract development and glaucoma. This is 
important to understand, if the retina gets affected by the disease, person will have problems in his/her vision. Also, here the loss of vision is irreversible. So, as an ASHA, you must encourage 
all the target population to get their regular eye examination as well as control their high blood 
pressure and diabetes. 
3.9.1.1 r ole of the ASHA in prevention of eye diseases in people with Diabetes 
1. All people aged 30 years and above with diabetes should get tested for eye disease.
2. Educate diabetic patients and their family members that diabetes can result in eye problems.
3. Educate diabetic patients about the importance of having a controlled blood sugar through various means like lifestyle modification and/or medicines. 
4. Ensuring all diabetic patients in your community to get an annual eye examination by the eye doctor, even if they have controlled sugar status.
5. Refer diabetic persons to the nearest AB-HWC for timely detection of diabetic eye diseases, if any. 
3.9.2 Prematurity and Eyes 
Those babies that are born premature (before complete term) such as before 32 weeks of gestation or whose birth weight is less than 1500 gm, their retina (back lining of the eye) is not "
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,25,"How to Deal with Common Eye Problems at Community Level 25fully developed. These children may also have difficulty in breathing and low oxygen. They may 
be kept in neonatal units if they are born within hospitals for support and management. 
These babies require an eye check-up within 30 days of birth so as to examine whether the retina 
is okay or not.  If there is abnormal development, these babies can have blindness if not detected and treated early. Babies that are very low birth weight (<1200 gm birth weight), eye examination 
should be done earlier.
You with support from ASHA Facilitator (AF) and/or MPW/ANM, will ensure that all babies born in 
your area with weight less than 1500 gm or born before 32 weeks must get an eye check-up done 
within 30 days of birth through RBSK team. Inform parents about the screening, mobilise them 
and accompany them, if required for eye examination. Ensure follow-up care of such children on a regular basis as advised by the referral centre. 
3.10 Eye Donation
The front transparent portion of the eye that covers pupil is called as cornea. In certain 
conditions, it becomes opaque and it leads 
to corneal blindness. Persons affected with same, can get rid of their blindness by replacing with a healthy cornea tissue. 
Donating the eyes after death of the 
individual is referred as ‘Eye Donation’. 
Eye donation is an act when one person 
can donate their eyes to persons suffering 
from corneal blindness. An eye donation helps 3-4 persons to regain their vision. 
There is a huge demand and the supply 
is not sufficient for the people who need it. Thus, as a society, we need to come forward for this noble cause and help 
our community. You should encourage 
community members to understand this and agree to donate their eyes after death. Very often the individual usually agrees, 
but the relatives have a problem after the 
death. There is no cost involved in eye donation; even the person receiving the 
cornea does not have to pay any amount. 
It is a voluntary act and is free of cost. A person of any age, sex, religion, caste can donate his/her eyes. Donated eyes are never bought or sold. In your target area, people with diabetes, hypertension and asthma can also 
donate their eyes after death. 
The eyes can be donated at home or hospital after death. The eyes/corneas are taken out by 
the trained team within 6 hours of death, beyond which time, eyes cannot be donated. For those 
ready to donate their eyes, the relatives must call up the nearest eye bank at National toll-
free number (24X7) – 1800114770 and 1919 (for metro cities). On receiving the call, the team 
members will visit them within 6 hours of death and collect the eyes/corneas.  Whiteness of Cornea

taken out by trained team members. It will not lead to any defect of the face. 
You along with the other primary health care team members at AB-HWC, VHSNC members, MAS 
members, support groups, etc. will motivate community members for eye donation. 
As an ASHA, explain to the community that pledging for eye donation can be done by anyone 
during their lifetime. Persons who have pledged their eyes, must inform their family members 
regarding the pledge so that they would be able to contact the nearest eye bank after their 
death. Even if the pledge has not been done, the family members can still call the eye bank and donate the eyes of the deceased person. Any person can donate their eyes; even those who have undergone any eye operation or have any eye disease condition, except those with 
Hepatitis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), rabies, blood cancers or stage IV cancers.
3.10.1 r ole of ASHA in Eye Donation 
1. You along with the other primary health care team members at AB-HWC, VHSNC members, 
MAS, support groups, etc. motivate community members for Eye donation. 
2. Organise community meetings to educate people about Eye donation.
3. Organise pledge ceremonies on important village days/festivals about eye donation. Remember, every year, August 25 to September 8 is observed as National Eye Donation fortnight all over our country. 
4. Facilitate whenever required, for willing family to donate eyes of the deceased persons. Inform the CHO/MPW/MO available at the nearest AB-HWCs regarding such families.  Some Myths and Facts about Eye Donation
1. MYTH: Removal of eyes causes defect of the face.
 FACT: Removal of eyes does not produce any defect of the face.
2. MYTH: Eye donation interferes with or delays customary final rites.
 FACT: Eye donation does not interfere with or delay final rites, as the process of taking the 
whole eyes out of the face takes less than 20 minutes.
3. MYTH: Eyes of aged donors are not acceptable.
 FACT: All donor eyes are acceptable irrespective of donor’s age, including eyes of 
premature/still born babies.
4. MYTH: An entire eye can be transplanted.
 FACT: Only the cornea can be transplanted for regaining vision. 
5. MYTH: Human eyes can be bought or sold.
 FACT: Selling or buying of human eyes is illegal.Precautions to be taken after death for donation of eyes
The family members should take care that there is no wind or breeze where the body of the 
deceased (dead person) is kept, and the fan should be switched off in that room. This will 
prevent drying of the eye. The head of the deceased person should be supported by pillow, 
eyelids should be closed and eyes can be covered with moist cotton piece or ice. This will enable corneas to remain fresh for donation."

Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,28,"Training Manual on Eye Care for ASHA at Ayushman Bharat – Health and Wellness Centres 284.2 General health messages which also impact Eye Health
1. While driving/travelling, wear a seat belt so injuries are avoided to both the body as well as 
the eyes. Those driving two wheelers, must wear helmets covered with the front glass. 
2. Keep hands and faces clean to avoid infections, including eye infections. 
3. Protect your health, including your eye health, by not smoking.
4.3 Healthy Eye messages for mothers and caregivers for their children
1. Clean their eyes immediately after birth. You will teach the mother/caregivers to provide eye care to the newborn, if required by use of an eye ointment. 
2. A baby with eye discharge needs treatment immediately; inform them to seek help from the 
nearest AB-HWC. 
3. Make sure all mothers/caregivers report if their child is not looking at them or not looking 
straight after the age of 6 weeks. Mobilise the mother/caregivers for screening of children for eye care by RBSK team. 
4. Children should not play with or near sharp objects to avoid eye injuries. 
5. Avoid applying ‘kajal’ or ‘surma’ in the eyes of the children.
6. Promote early and exclusive breastfeeding for six months. 
7. Mothers and children should be fully immunized including against rubella and measles. 
8. Regular vitamin A supplementation of pre-school children from age of 9 months is important for good vision and healthy growth.

10. Children should be made secure while travelling by taking all possible preventive measures 
to avoid eye injuries. 
4.4 Simple Eye Care messages in Health Promotion 
Infections of the eye spread very rapidly if proper care is not taken. Ways to maintain eye health 
are as follows:
1. Keep eyes clean by washing them with clean water. Washing eyes at bedtime is very good as 
it removes the dirt and dust collected throughout the day.
2. Do not work in poor light. Reading in poor light can strain eyes.
3. Always use a clean cloth to wipe eyes. Do not use saris, dhotis, or sleeves of clothes to wipe eyes. These may cause serious infection in the eyes. Eye diseases such as conjunctivitis and trachoma spread by this way.
4. Each person should use a separate cloth, towel, or handkerchief for wiping eyes. If one eye is already infected, use a separate clean cloth for each eye.
5. Avoid the glare. Do not stare at the sun and other bright objects. 
6. Never walk out in the sun without sunglasses."
Eye Care Training Manual for ASHA,29,"Health Promotion in Eye Care 297. Eat a diet rich in Vitamin A and appropriate breastfeeding by mothers (colostrum is rich in 
Vitamin A). 
8. Do follow the 20-20-20 rule of eye care when using a computer/laptop, mobile phone, or watching television. Every 20 minutes, refocus your eyes for 20 seconds to an object located at least 20 feet away.
9. Report any eye infection to a health worker. Do not use home remedies for eye medication. Do not use medicines given by road-side medicine sellers. These may not help and may even 
cause blindness.
10. Eye drops and eye ointment only provided by a medical doctor should be used. Do not use 
any eye medicine without any medical prescription. 
11. Educate community members to pay special attention in using the eye drops. They might not be able to differentiate between eye drops and ear drops, and may put ear drops into their 
eyes. 
12. Patient with eye infection should avoid going into the swimming pool and visiting public places.

8. Wash your hands with soap and clean water after using the eye ointment. 
9. The eye ointment should be applied only after putting all the eye drops. 
10. Explain to the individual that their vision will be blurry (not clear) for a few minutes. 
11. Close the cap of the ointment tube. Once the eye ointment is open, it must be used only for one month. Discard the eye ointment tube after one month of opening (even if it is not empty).
12. Do not use eye ointment given to another person/family member. 
13. You must put the eye ointment at the right time interval as suggested by your medical doctor."

Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,1,"Introduction 1 IntroductionCHAPTER 1
In the last fifteen years primary health care has focused on health of mothers, children 
and adolescents, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases and other chronic 
communicable diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy and HIV infection. The primary health care 
system primarily focused on delivery of care related to reproductive, maternal, new-born, child health, infectious diseases and nutrition and the newly added Non-Communicable Diseases. 
With the launch of the Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness program, a wider range of services 
are being rolled out with the aim of providing Comprehensive Primary Health Care to the communities. Emergency and trauma care services is one of the expanded package of services being provided through the Ayushman Bharat-Health and Wellness Centres (AB-HWCs).
As you already know, there are some health conditions which require immediate medical care 
and need to reach an appropriate health facility for treatment as soon as possible, usually within 
an hour. These conditions are life-threatening and therefore it is extremely important that they 
receive the right care at the right time. A common example is an accident leading to severe bleeding or a person suffering a heart attack. These emergency situations may arise at any time and can affect anyone. The broad goal of emergency care is to intervene as quickly as possible to 
avoid life-threatening morbidity and death in emergency and trauma cases. You might encounter 
such cases in the community during field visits or they may directly present to the SHC-HWC. This module will train you on your role in management and referral of emergency conditions.
What is an emergency?
An emergency is any condition that threatens the life or well-being of a person. A health emergency comprises a range of conditions which may pose a threat to life and require immediate medical 
care. Emergencies that are commonly encountered in the community may span from accidents 
and trauma to emergencies arising out of chronic diseases of the heart or lung. Trauma is one of the most common emergencies that occur in the community and a major reason for morbidity and mortality in India. The challenge with respect to most emergency and trauma cases is that they 
are non-discriminatory in the sense that they can happen to anyone irrespective of age, gender, 
economic status etc."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,2,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres2 What is emergency care?
Emergency Care, in principle is based on three Ps:
Preserve Life!!
Promote Healing!!
Prevent Complications !!
You as an ASHA can play a crucial role in identifying and seeking help for emergency and their 
prevention in the community. This module will help you understand your role in emergency and 
trauma care. You will also find simple to use protocols in managing such cases as well. "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,3,"Role of ASHA in Emergency and  Trauma Care 3 Role of ASHA in Emergency and  
Trauma CareCHAPTER 2
Emergencies can present in various forms and have various causes. Most cases of emergency 
are avoidable by creating awareness regarding their prevention. Even when the emergency 
has occurred, prompt stabilization and safe referral significantly reduces death and disability. 
As an ASHA, you would be assisting the ANM/MPW (M/F) at the community level in undertaking preventive activities in relation to Emergency and Trauma care, ensuring scene safety in emergency situations and also in providing basic first aid for the victims whenever need be. 
In the next few chapters, you will learn how to: 
A. Create awareness among the members of the community regarding prevention of 
common emergency conditions.
B. Recognize life threatening critical illness requiring immediate medical care in the community.
C. Promptly stabilize such cases at the scene of emergency.
D Seek immediate help and ensure safe transport of such cases to the nearest appropriate 
Public Health Facility.
E. Provide follow up care to victims of emergencies who are referred back from higher centres."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,4,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres4 CHAPTER 3
Management and Prevention of 
Common Emergency Conditions
Trauma and emergency situations, in many cases, are avoidable. The emergency situations which 
can largely be prevented are listed below. 
1. Accidents and trauma: Accidents leading to trauma commonly occur in the home, at the workplace, on the roads and in playgrounds. Most of these accidents are avoidable if 
proper precautions are taken.
2. Burns including lightening injuries and electrocution:  Burns occurring from flames, hot 
liquids and steam, electric shocks and certain chemicals like acids, or alkali  burns caused 
by lime, or some alkali based toilet cleaners etc are all preventable. Alkali burns are more 
serious than acid burns as the damage is ongoing.
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,5,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 5 3. Bites: The three common cases of bites which are preventable are animal bites, snake 
bites and scorpion bites. Educate about do s and don’t.
4. Poisoning: Cases of unintentional ingestion of poisonous substances commonly available 
domestically can be prevented. 
5. Near-Drowning: Drowning is most commonly seen among small children and infants in 
the community.
6. Choking: Choking can occur in adults but are more commonly seen in children who 
accidentally ingest objects like coins/toys, seeds, button, batteries etc.
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,6,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres6 7. Exposure Illnesses: 
Heat Exhaustion and Heat Stroke: These occur on prolonged exposure to heat and !
can sometimes be fatal. 
Hypothermia and Frostbites: These occur on prolonged exposure to cold leading to !
a decrease in body temperature which if left untreated, could be fatal.  
 
8. Emergencies like heart attacks, stroke and diabetic coma caused by uncontrolled 
hypertension and diabetes. 
9. Emergencies arising out of allergic reactions are preventable if the allergen is known. Proper history taking and identification of the allergen can help prevent the emergency situation in subsequent times. 
All of these are emergency conditions that can be prevented by being aware and taking specific 
precautions against them. You will play an important role in raising awareness among community 
members about these emergencies and educating them regarding their prevention.
In any case of emergency, the first step is to call for help: 
Immediately call the ambulance (102) or any other state specific ambulance services in !!
place.
Inform the CHO and MO about the situation.!!
Stabilization of sick or injured persons is required to prevent their condition from deteriorating 
further too quickly before they can reach a medical facility for treatment. As you have learnt in 
the previous section, you must inform the CHO and MO and call for an ambulance as soon as you 
suspect an emergency. After calling for help, the victim needs to be stabilized till the time he/she is being transferred to the health facility. In this section you will learn about general and specific measures of stabilization."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,7,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 7 Caution: It is important to note that stabilization of any case of emergency requires close 
contact. Due precautions must be taken, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, while carrying out all 
stabilization procedures.
Stabilization of any case of emergency involves two approaches:
1. Removing any imminent danger to the person
2. Specific measures for stabilization
1. Removing imminent danger
Scene safety
This is done to ensure safety of self, patient as well as the bystanders 
and removing the patient from the emergency situation wherever 
required, eg. Dangerous traffic, sharp objects, slope of ground, 
electric live circuit, etc.
Safe Transport
Once scene safety has been secured, with great care, lift the injured victim without bending him/her anywhere. Take special care that the head and neck do not bend. The victim should 
be transported in a flat condition as far as possible. However, if there is any deformity of the 
backbone or spine, the victim should be immobilized in that position only, and no attempt should be made to lay him/her flat.
If you have help, have another person put the stretcher in place.
In cases of trauma, the approach is (H)ABCDE instead of ABCDE. Because trauma !!
cases need management of life-threatening hemorrhage (bleeding) as the first step 
before ABCDE.
 This approach should be performed within 1-2 minutes and repeated whenever the victim’s condition worsens.
H: Hemorrhage (bleeding) control  
A: Airway  B: Breathing  C: Circulation  D: Disability  E: Exposure
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,8,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres8 2. Specific measures for stabilization
Haemorrhage/bleeding control
Haemorrhage or bleeding control needs to be addressed first only in the cases of trauma where 
there obvious visible bleeding from any part of the victim’s body. Profuse or uncontrolled bleeding 
should be given maximum priority. Remember that you can only manage the bleeding when the 
bleeding is from the extremities like the hands and the legs and not internally. Internal bleeding can only be managed by a doctor, however you can attempt to control it. The procedure for haemorrhage control will be discussed in detail in the following sections.
Note: Whenever and wherever the concerned victim in ANY emergency situation is a pregnant 
woman, there could be vaginal bleeding which is heavy (Heavy bleeding is defined as a clean 
pad or cloth becoming soaked within less than 5 minutes), but is not yet shocked (they are able 
to stand or sit up and speak normally). Any problem that might be hindering the circulation of the 
woman, unless rapidly treated, could lead to shock or heart failure.
Note: In all non-trauma cases, you shall make use of the ABCDE approach.
Airway
Check whether the passage from nose to throat and lung is clear of obstruction. Obstruction to 
the airway can be caused by food, swollen tongue falling back to the throat, thick mucus or blood 
in the airway, or any foreign body stuck in the airway. If the airway is blocked then tilt back the 
head of the person and lift the chin. If any visible obstruction is seen then try to remove it from 
the mouth with a clean cloth wrapped around your finger. 
(Caution: If there is neck or head injury then only chin lift should be done without turning the head 
of the person.)
Breathing 
Check whether the person is breathing properly. A person can only survive a few minutes without 
oxygen. Normal breathing rate for adults is 17-20 breaths per minute, for children between 1-5 
years is 40 breaths per minute and for infants is 50 breaths per minute. In case of irregular 
breathing rates, arrange for oxygen for the patient. If the breathing has stopped, mouth to mouth breathing should be given. (Caution: In times of COVID-19 pandemic, care must be taken since mouth to mouth breathing might increase risk of spread of infection.)"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,9,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 9 Circulation
Check for pulse (in the wrist- radial pulse, or neck- carotid pulse) to assess circulation i.e., pumping 
of blood by the heart. Normal pulse in adults ranges between 60-90 per minute. 
In unconscious patients, you should always check for carotid pulse.
How to feel for the carotid pulse?
The pulse from the carotids may be felt on either side of the front of the neck just below !!
the angle of the jaw.
To check for pulse, place your index and middle fingers on your neck to the side of your !!
windpipe.
Count the pulses you feel for 15 seconds.!!
Multiply this number by 4 to obtain the heart rate.!!
Disability
Check the victim’s level of consciousness using the AVPU method.
A: Alert: The victim is aware and is responding to the surrounding on their own. He/ she will also 
be able to follow your instructions, open eyes spontaneously, and track objects.
V: Verbally Responsive: The victim’s eyes do not open spontaneously. Their eyes will open only 
in response to voice/calling out his/her name. 
P: Responsive to Pain: The victim’s eyes do not open on their own and will only respond if a 
painful stimulus is given, eg. pressure to the chest. The victim may move, moan, or cry out directly 
in response to the painful stimuli.
U: Unresponsive/unconscious: The victim does not respond spontaneously and does not respond 
to verbal or painful stimuli. 
Note: whenever and wherever the concerned victim is a pregnant woman, sometimes you may 
find on AVPU assessment that the woman is Unresponsive. (Do not panic in such case and 
remember that it is not rare to find that women experiencing pregnancy related emergencies 
could be unresponsive or unconscious from the intensity of pain)"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,10,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres10 Exposure 
Minimize heat loss by covering the victim’s body.
If the victim is unresponsive but breathing, turn them into a recovery position and wait for help 
to arrive. 
Recovery position
The recovery position is when a person is lying down on their side. 
Below is a step-by-step depiction of placing the victim in the recovery position. 
Step 1 Kneel beside the person, open his/her 
airway by tilting the head and lifting the chin.
Caution: Do not attempt to head-tilt, 
chin-lift if the person presents with any suspected neck injury like in road-traffic accidents.
Straighten his/her legs.Place the arm nearer to you at right 
angles to his/her body, elbow bent and move the hand palm to the upper side.
Step 2 Bring the arm further from you across the 
chest and hold the hand, palm outwards, against the person’s cheek.
Step 3 With your other hand, grasp the thigh 
further from you and pull the knee up, keeping the foot flat on ground.
Legs straightElbow bent
Open the airway 
first using Head 
and Chin tilt
Place the back of 
the hand against 
her/his cheek 
and hold it there
Grasping the leg above 
the knee, roll the casualty 
towards youUse your knee to 
stop the casualty 
rolling too far.
Holding the 
casualty’s 
head against 
her/his cheek as they turn 
supports and 
protects the head and face."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,11,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 11 Step 4 Keeping his/her hand pressed against 
his/her cheek, pull at the thigh to roll the person towards and on to her side.
Step 5 Tilt the head back to make sure the airway remains open. Adjust the hand under the cheek if 
necessary, so that the head stays in this tilted position.
Step 6 Adjust the upper leg, if necessary, so that both the hip and knee are bent at the right angles.
Infant Recovery Position: Cradle the infant in your arms, with the head tilted downwards to 
prevent the child from choking on its tongue or by inhaling vomit. Maintain this position until you 
get medical help. 
The recovery position will help in keeping their airway clear and they will be able to breathe 
properly. If the victim happens to vomit, this position will ensure that he/she doesn’t choke. This position prevents the tongue from falling back and blocking the throat. Since the head is slightly 
lower than the rest of the body, it allows liquids to drain from the mouth, reducing the risk of 
choking on fluids or vomit. This position should also be used in fits or seizure after the shaking movements have stopped. 
(Caution: If you suspect that the victim has suffered injury to the neck or spine, do not attempt 
the recovery position.)
While the ABCDE and scene safety approach is almost universal and should be carried out for 
every emergency situation, some other approaches could be used for particular emergency 
situations which are the specific measures which you shall learn in the following sections. 
3.1. Trauma and Accidents
3.1.1. Recognising life threatening situations
The most common warning signs of a case that is life threatening or requires immediate care, involves: 
Bleeding that will not stop
!!
Breathing problems (difficulty breathing, shortness of breath)!!
Change in mental status (such as unusual behavior, confusion, difficulty waking up/gaining !!
consciousness)
Chest pain!!
Choking!!
Coughing up or vomiting blood!!
Fainting or loss of consciousness!!Head tilted 
well back
Hand supporting 
head Bent arm gives stability. 
Bent leg presses the 
body up and prevents the 
casualty rolling forward"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,12,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres12 Trauma or severe injury to any part of the body especially head or spine injury, injury to !!
abdomen or other vital organs like eyes, any major or severe wound
Sudden, severe pain anywhere in the body!!
Sudden dizziness, weakness, or change in vision!!
Sudden weakness in any limb or of face!!
Severe abdominal pain or pressure!!
Seizures/fits!!
If the situation is found to be life-threatening, the only focus should be on keeping the victim alive 
till help arrives. In all cases of emergency your role is to ensure prompt stabilization and safe 
transport to the nearest appropriate public health facility. The stabilization process should be 
continued till the arrival of ambulance. 
3.1.2. Management protocol
Specific Measures 
Trauma or accident is the most common type of emergency. Though it can be fatal, major disability 
or even death can be prevented by providing stabilization using two modes:
Immobilization!!
Control of bleeding!!
You learnt in the previous section that you should always look for signs of bleeding and swelling. 
You might be able to see swelling and redness around a bone which could indicate fracture. In 
this sub section, we shall learn about how to suspect a fracture, immobilize an injured body part 
of the victim and control excessive bleeding.
Immobilization is required whenever a fracture of bone is suspected. A patient with fracture may 
present with following possible signs and symptoms: 
The break may have been felt or heard!!
Pain at or near the area of the injury!!
Pain when gentle pressure is applied over the area!!
Difficult or impossible normal movement of the limb!!
Deformity, abnormal twist or shortening of limb!!
Swelling over and around the area!!
A coarse grating sound if one end of the bone moves against the other!!
In case of fracture, use the RICER approach.
1. R: Rest the affected body part, ie., immobilization. Use splints/strips of bark/sleeve of 
cardboard to immobilize the bone. The pictures below show how fractures in different 
body parts can be immobilized.
2. I: Ice can be applied over the suspected fractured area (only if there is no external 
bleeding).
3. C: Compression of the area using a bandage but make sure it is not too tight.
4. E: Elevate the affected body part to prevent further swelling."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,13,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 13 5. R: Refer the person to a Medical Officer immediately. (Always remember to inform CHO 
beforehand) 
Caution:
Never rub or massage a broken body part or the skin above a bone that you suspect to !!
be broken.
Wherever a severe injury is seen especially to the neck, immobilize using heavy !!
towels or rolled sheets on both sides of the neck or hold the head and neck to prevent 
movement. 
If the victim has suffered a two-wheeler/motorcycle accident, and is wearing a helmet, !!
then do not attempt to remove the helmet. You may open the wind shield of the helmet 
without disturbing the placement. This would help prevent movement of the neck and 
head and will protect against any injury. 
 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,14,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres14 Bleeding could range from minor, major to even life threatening and hence it is important to try 
everything to stop the bleeding. If the bleeding is at the site of the neck, it is possible that it could 
cause blocking in the airway. 
Wash your hands before you attempt to stop bleeding in a person.!!
Apply pressure on the site of bleeding using a clean cloth. Use the material that you !!
already have and not waste time in searching for proper dressing material. Make sure that 
the cloth you use is clean. 
Press on the wound for at least 10 minutes to give the blood time to clot.!!
Once you are holding pressure on the bleeding site, do not remove the pressure to check !!
if the bleeding has stopped. It may be useful to make the victim lie down on 
!!
their back and raising the injured part above 
the level of the victim’s chest. This will help in 
reducing the flow of blood. 
If the bleeding does not stop with pressure then !!
bandage the injured part with a cloth firmly (but 
not very tightly as it might restrict the circulation and make the arm/leg turn blue). If bleeding 
strikes through the dressing, bandage another 
firmly over the top.
If bleeding or injury is severe, raise the feet and 
!!
lower the head to prevent shock.Do not use a tourniquet. It can make the bleeding worse, and may result in tissue damage 
!!
and even gangrene.Remember to also protect yourself from infection. If you have any open wound on your 
!!
skin, first cover the wound before helping the victim. 
Control of excessive bleeding
1. Raise the injured part
2. Apply pressure on the wound directly by tying a clean cloth/bandage 3. Hold the pressure4. Tie the bleeding site with a bandage firmly but not very tightly.5. Hold this pressure until help arrives. 
3.1.3. Safe Referral/Transport
As you have been taught before, you should call for help as soon as you recognise a life-
threatening situation. You need to know the public health facilities nearest to you which provide 
care for trauma and accident related emergencies. Mapping of all the nearest referral centres 
should be done and information should be kept handy regarding facilities: 
i. Which can provide primary care for emergencies like superficial bleeding wounds etc.
ii. Which provide secondary care (where a Medical Officer is present) for emergencies like minor head injury, unconsciousness, seizures etc.
iii. Where specialist doctors are available who can manage emergencies like severe head injury, emergencies related to pregnancies and new born. 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,15,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 15 1. You need to keep the phone numbers for all available ambulance services handy with you at 
all times.
2. You need to keep the contact numbers of the CHO and MO handy with you at all times.
3. You need to stay informed about the facility where the victim has been referred and follow up once he/she is discharged.
Table in Annexure II may be used to understand what cases can be treated at which level so that 
time is not wasted in referring to facility that is not equipped to address the case.
3.1.4. Follow-up Care
Most cases of emergency and trauma require care even after discharge from the health facility, 
for complete recovery. As the ASHA, you shall be involved in identifying those patients who 
have received treatment for emergency or trauma but require follow-up care. The follow up 
care could either be for a short duration (till complete recovery) or for a longer period of time. Your role will be to provide follow-up care and support to the patient and their family whenever required.  
In cases where the patient is a victim of trauma/accident, you could provide the following care:
Educate the person on wound care: Major wounds usually take a few weeks to 
!!
heal completely. You can ensure that he/she visits the health facility regularly for 
change in dressing, takes prescribed medicines regularly and follows good hygiene 
practices.
Check for any complication in healing: In case the wound gets infected or healing is !!
delayed, the patient will develop redness, swelling, fever, foul smell, pain around the 
wound, pus/discharge etc. If any of these is present, inform them and refer him/her to the 
nearest SHC-HWC.
Assistive devices: If the patient has been provided with any assistive devices like !!
wheelchair, walking crutches, immobilization devices etc., then on your follow-up visits, 
check for the status and maintenance of these devices and also note the difficulties the 
patient is facing if any. In case they require any assistive device after discharge for any 
disability that develops later, inform the CHO and facilitate arrangement of such devices from the PHC-HWC.
If any patient has been prescribed/advised physiotherapy, facilitate by mobilizing them to 
!!
the SHC-HWC for the same on designated days.In case a patient develops permanent disability, ensure that he/she receives appropriate 
!!
palliative care. Link him/her with the palliative care services provided through the AB-HWCs.Provide psycho-social support to help the person overcome the crisis.
!!
3.1.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
Some of the key messages you need to make use of, to educate the community regarding 
prevention of emergency situations like accidents etc. leading to trauma are: 
1. Make sure there are no accident-prone areas in the house (eg. do not let water accumulate on the floor, clean up spills immediately, keep sharp objects like knives and scissors out of reach of children, do not store heavy objects at the edge of shelves, remove any sharp 
protruding edge of furniture, "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,16,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres16 2. Make sure all areas of the house are well lit.
3. Get eyesight checked regularly, especially for older people in the house.
4. Take proper precautions if any occupational hazards are present at workplace (eg. caution 
while working with heavy machinery, use of safety guards to prevent injury from thresher and cutter while farming, handling of chemicals, live wires etc.)
5. Always stay alert and look in all directions while walking on/crossing roads and streets.
6. Always wear seat belt or helmet when traveling in vehicles.
7. Avoid the use of mobile phones while crossing/walking on the roads, driving or riding. 
8. When driving vehicles, always follow safety and traffic rules.
9. Teach children to be safe while playing outdoors.
3.2. Burns
3.2.1. Recognizing life threatening situation
3.2.2. Management Protocol 
Specific Measures
In cases of burns, use the STOP approach:
1. S: Strip burnt clothes/jewelry.
2. T: Turn on COOL tap and let the burn wash under cool water for at least 10 minutes. 
3. O: Organize safe referral.
4. P: Protect burn with a clean cloth.
Caution:
Do not apply ice directly over the burn.!!
Do not apply any lotions/creams over the burn.!!
Do not attempt to remove cloth stuck to the skin that is burnt.!!
Do not peel away burnt skin or blisters.!!
3.2.3. Safe Referral/Transport
As you have been taught before, you should call for help as soon as you identify a life-threatening 
situation. You need to know the public health facilities nearest to you which provide care for 
trauma and accident related emergencies. Mapping of all the nearest referral centres should be 
done and information should be kept handy regarding facilities: 
i. Which can provide primary care for emergencies like superficial burns etc.
ii. Which provide secondary care (where a Medical Officer is present) for burn emergencies. 
iii. Where specialist doctors are available who can manage emergencies like severe burns etc."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,17,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 17 1. You need to keep the phone numbers for all available ambulance services handy with you 
at all times.
2. You need to keep the contact numbers of the CHO and MO handy with you at all times.
3. You need to stay informed about the facility where the patient has been referred and follow up once he/she is discharged.
Table in Annexure II may be used to understand what cases can be treated at which level so that 
time is not wasted in referring to facility that is not equipped to address the case.
3.2.4. Follow-up Care
Most cases of extensive burns require care even after discharge from the health facility, for 
complete recovery. As the ASHA, you will be involved in identifying those patients who have 
received treatment for burns but require follow-up care either for a short duration until complete 
recovery or for a longer period of time which is called palliative care. Your role will be to provide follow-up care and providing support to the patient and their family whenever required.  
In cases where the patient is a victim of burns, you could provide the following care:
Educate the patient on wound care: Major burn wounds usually take a few weeks to heal 
!!
completely. You can ensure that he/she visits the health facility regularly for change in

!!
3.2.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
Some of the key messages you need to make use of, to educate the community regarding 
prevention of emergency situations like Burns are:
1.	Never leave children unattended in the kitchen.
2.	Always switch off stove/oven when not in use.
3.	Do not handle/be careful while handling very hot liquids.
4.	If any chemical like cleaning acid, lime or alkaline based toilet cleaners etc is there in the 
house, keep it away safely.
5.	Burns can also be caused by steam, eg. Steam from pressure cookers, etc.
Electrocution:
1.	Stay alert while using any electrical appliance inside or outside the house
2.	Use of rubber slippers while dealing with live electric wires, sockets etc. "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,18,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres18 3.	Do not leave any electrical appliance near water eg. Iron box, heater, etc.
4.	Keep small children away from electric appliances, plug points, etc.
5.	Do not go near electric grids or live wires.
Lightening Injuries: 
As you may have seen, lightening is the electric discharge that happens during thunderstorms. In 
some cases, this can be very dangerous when the lightening comes in contact with the body. In 
most situations, lightning often travels over the skin rather than through the body and hence, most 
victims of lightening injuries survive. The most common immediate effect of lightening injuries is on the respiratory system of the body which can cause cardiac arrest leading to death. 
How to recognise life threatening situations pertaining to lightening injuries?
You should treat every case of lightening injury as immediate and refer to the nearest appropriate 
facility as soon as possible. However, there are some signs that you can look for in the victim to understand the severity and provide stabilization.
Loss of consciousness 
!!
Loss of memory!!
Confusion !!
A feathering or fern shaped burn on the skin (This is not !!
very common, but whenever present, is a classical sign of lightening injury). 
All of the above signs you will be able to see in the victim, when you check for AVPU and follow ABCDE protocol.
Preventing lightening injuries:
Even though lightening injuries are dangerous, it is largely possible to prevent getting struck by lightning. The following key messages can be used for awareness generation in the community 
to avoid injuries related to lightening:
1. Prevention of indoor lightening casualties:
Even though houses provide safe shelter during a lightning storm, you may still be at risk. 
!!
It is a myth that lightening injuries cannot be caused indoors. 
Avoid water!!  Do NOT bathe, shower, wash dishes, or have any other contact with water 
during a thunderstorm because lightning can travel through a housing plumbing vent.
Avoid electronic equipment!!  Do NOT use your computers, laptops, game systems, 
washers, dryers, stoves, or anything connected to an electrical outlet. Lightning can travel 
through electrical systems, radio and television reception systems, and any metal wires 
or bars in concrete walls or flooring. 
Avoid windows, doors, porches, and concrete!!  Do NOT lie on concrete floors during a 
thunderstorm. Also, avoid leaning on concrete walls. Lightning can travel through any 
metal wires or bars in concrete walls or flooring. 
2. Prevention of outdoor lightening casualties:
Be aware !!
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,19,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 19 If aware about thunderstorms predictions, postpone outdoor activities, or make sure !!
adequate safe shelter is readily available.
Go indoors!!  Remember the phrase, “When thunder roars, go indoors.” Find a safe, 
enclosed shelter when you hear thunder. Safe shelters include homes, offices, shopping 
centres, and hard-top vehicles with the windows rolled up.
Seek shelter immediately even if caught out in the open !! If you are caught in an open 
area, act quickly to find adequate shelter. The most important action is to remove yourself 
from danger. 
Remember:
Crouching or getting low to the ground can reduce your chances of being struck, but does 
not remove you from danger.
If one is caught outside with no safe shelter nearby, the following actions may reduce their risk:
Immediately get off elevated areas such as hills, mountain ridges, or peaks.!!
Never lie flat on the ground. Crouch down in a ball-like position with your head tucked !!
and hands over the ears so that they are down low with minimal contact with the ground. 
Never shelter under an isolated tree.
!!
Never use a cliff or rocky overhang for shelter.!!
Immediately get out of and away from ponds, lakes, and other bodies of water.!!
Stay away from objects that conduct electricity (barbed wire fences, power lines, windmills, !!
etc.).Separate
!!  If one is in a group during a thunderstorm, separate from each other. This will 
reduce the number of injuries if lightning strikes the ground.
DO NOT do the following: 
Do not stay in open vehicles, structures, and spaces!!  during a thunderstorm, avoid open 
vehicles such as motorcycles. Be sure to avoid open structures such as playgrounds.Do not stay near tall structures
!!  Do NOT lie on concrete floors during a thunderstorm. 
Also, avoid leaning on concrete walls. 
3.3. Bites (Animal bite/snake bite/scorpion sting/other insect bites)
3.3.1. Recognizing life threatening situations
Irrespective of the nature of the bite, i.e. even if you feel that the victim’s condition does not 
appear serious, you should refer the case to the nearest health facility since symptoms could 
have delayed occurrence and shall need observation to understand the fatality of the situation. 
However, sometimes an animal bite or sting could present with obvious signs as follows which 
require immediate care:
Symptoms that are not just at the site of the bite or sting!!
If the bite appears infected (redness with or without pus, warmth, fever, or a red streak !!
that spreads toward the body)"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,20,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres20 An open or ulcerated bite wound could be suggestive of a scorpion bite!!
Wheezing!!
Shortness of breath!!
Chest pain or tightness!!
Sensation of the throat closing or difficulty speaking or swallowing!!
Faintness or weakness!!
3.3.2. Management Protocol
Specific Measures
Animal bites and scratches are commonly seen in both adults and children. Animal bites (dog, 
cat, monkey, and domestic animals like cow or horse, wild animals) may cause a deadly disease 
called rabies, if bitten by an infected animal. Rabies is caused by a virus which is present in the 
saliva of infected animals which can spread through bites or licks on broken skin. In case of animal bites, the following steps must be followed:
1. Wash the wound immediately with soap and running water for at least 10 minutes.
2. Reassure the victim.
3. Control any bleeding from the site of bite. Apply pressure but not too tightly since it can speed up the spread of virus.
4. Refer the victim immediately to a health facility for proper management and vaccination.
Caution:
Do not apply turmeric powder, chili powder, limestone, paste of leaves or plants on the !!
bite wound. 
Do not place coins, bark of trees or any other object on the bite wound.!!
Do not cut the wound open.!!
In case of a dog bite, you should ask the victim or their relatives/family to observe the dog !!
for 10 days to see if there are any behavioral changes in the dog. 
Snake bite:
In case of snake bite, use the RIGHT approach.
R: Reassure the person (70% of snakebites: from non- poisonous snakes only 50% poisonous 
snakes inject poison).
I: Immobilize the affected body part of the victim.
GH: Get to the Hospital immediately.T: Tell the doctor at the referred facility about presence of any symptoms (Pain, weakness, 
bleeding, etc.).
Caution:
Do not tie a tourniquet in cases of snake bite.!!"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,21,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 21 Snake venom does not spread through blood.!!
Do not try to suck out poison from snake bite, or cut the wound open.!!
Do not make the victim move too much.!!
In most cases, if the snake has been killed, it should be taken to the hospital along with !!
the patient to make sure the treatment is right BUT DO NOT waste time in searching for 
the snake. It could lead to more casualty if the snake is not dead and only injured. 
Scorpion sting/other insect bites:
In case of scorpion sting or other suspected poisonous insect bite, wash the wound immediately 
with soap and water and refer the victim to the nearest health facility.
3.3.3. Safe Referral/Transport
As you have been taught before, you should call for help as soon as you identify a life-threatening situation. You need to know the public health facilities nearest to you which provide care for 
emergencies related to bites. Mapping of all the nearest referral centres should be done and 
information should be kept handy regarding facilities – 
i. Which can provide primary care for emergencies like superficial bites etc.
ii. Which provide secondary care for emergencies from bites
iii. Where specialist doctors are available who can manage emergencies 
You need to keep the phone numbers for all available ambulance services handy with you at all times along with numbers of the CHO and MO.
You need to stay informed about the facility where the patient has been referred and follow up 
once he/she is discharged.
Table in Annexure II may be used to understand what cases can be treated at which level so that 
time is not wasted in referring to facility that is not equipped to address the case.
3.3.4. Follow-up Care
Most cases of bites do not require extensive care after discharge from the health facility, for complete recovery. As the ASHA, you will be involved in identifying those patients who have received 
treatment for bites but require follow-up care either for a short duration until complete recovery or 
for a longer period of time which is called palliative care. Y our role will be to provide follow-up care and providing support to the patient and family whenever your intervention is required.  
In cases where the patient is a victim of bites, you could provide the following care:
Educate the patient on wound care: Major bite wounds usually take a few weeks to heal 
!!
completely. You can ensure that he/she visits the health facility regularly for change in 
dressing, takes prescribed medicines regularly and follows good hygiene practices.

nearest SHC-HWC.
Assistive devices: If the patient has been provided with any assistive devices like !!
wheelchair, walking crutches, immobilization devices etc., then on your follow-up visits, 
check for the status and maintenance of these devices and also note the difficulties the "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,22,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres22 patient is facing if any. In case the patient requires any assistive device after discharge 
for any disability that develops later, inform the CHO and facilitate arrangement of such

!!
3.3.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
As you know, cases of bites are very much preventable for which you could use the following 
messages to educate the community. 
1. Do not unnecessarily go near animals. Teach children to not harm animals and be careful 
if they play with animals. Do not leave small children unattended outside the house.
2. Stay alert and wear adequate protective clothes, shoes, etc. to prevent snake and scorpion 
bites while going to the field or other areas.
3. For farmers and people working in forests or fields – Always wear protective gear while going for work.
4.	Make adequate safety provisions to prevent snakes, scorpions, other insects and animals from entering the house.
3.4. Pregnancy related emergencies
3.4.1. Recognizing life threatening situations
It is important to understand that pregnant women are not only vulnerable to pregnancy related emergencies but could also be a victim of trauma/accident or any of the other emergency 
conditions. Hence, when you are attending to a distressed pregnant woman, always consider it 
an emergency. The following are signs of emergency:
Any bleeding from the vagina:
!!
Heavy bleeding with severe stomach pain in the first three months of pregnancy!
Heavy bleeding with cramping in the !
first three to four months of pregnancy 
Bleeding with abdominal pain in the !
last three months of pregnancy
Severe bleeding within the first few !
days after delivery
Headache and blurred vision!!
Dizziness, loss of consciousness or fits!!
Severe vomiting !!
Severe pain in the abdomen !!
Sudden and significant swelling of hands, !!
face and feet 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,23,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 23 Regular, increasingly intense contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy !!
3.4.2. Management Protocol 
(a) General Measures to be undertaken in pregnancy related emergencies remain the same as 
you have learnt in previous sections.
(b) Specific Measures
The first principles of dealing with pregnancy related emergencies are the same as for any 
emergency (see to the airway, breathing, and circulation). Eclampsia (headache, blurred vision, 
fits), antepartum haemorrhage (vaginal bleeding during pregnancy), postpartum haemorrhage 
(vaginal bleeding few days after delivery), ruptured ectopic pregnancy should be treated as emergencies and help should be called for as soon as possible. However, until help arrives, there 
are certain measures that you can take to stabilize the woman.
1. Eclampsia
If a pregnant woman presents with sudden headache, blurred vision and fits, provide basic first 
aid as you would in other cases of fits. Remember that the focus should be on keeping the airway clear of any obstructions, and seeing to it that the woman is able to breathe properly. The 
measures to take during fits include:
Do not leave the woman unattended and keep surrounding safe to avoid any maternal 
!!
injuries due to fits (eg. keeping pillows to avoid injury from surrounding objects, remove 
any objects in the way that can injure the woman further).
Placing a clean cloth between the teeth of the woman so that she does not bite the !!
tongue. If the biting or jittering of the teeth is vigorous, do not attempt this since it could 
hurt your fingers. 
Placing her in recovery position after the fits stop.!!
Caution: 
Do not attempt to hold the woman’s mouth open.!!
Do not hold the woman down or try to stop her movements or restrain her arms/legs tightly.!!
Do not offer the woman water or food until she is fully alert.!!
Antepartum Haemorrhage:
If a pregnant woman presents with vaginal bleeding, immediately call the ambulance and refer 
her to the nearest health facility where a gynaecologist is available. 
Post-Partum Haemorrhage: 
1. Uterine massage can help control the bleeding and should be done until bleeding is visibly less. Rub the uterus gently from outside immediately to keep the uterus well-contracted.
2. Encouraging the woman to empty her bladder. If she cannot urinate on her own, help her by trickling warm water over her abdomen.
3. Maintain the woman’s body warmth by covering with blanket.
4. Position the woman by making her lay flat, rising her legs to maintain blood pressure.
5. Keep the woman emotionally supported, and keep her calm."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,24,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres24 Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy
An ectopic pregnancy is a condition in which a fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus, 
most commonly the fallopian tube. Ectopic pregnancies usually do not reach term, and rupture 
around 10-12 weeks causing severe internal bleeding which may lead to shock and present as 
an emergency.
In many cases of ectopic pregnancy, the first presentation may be after it has ruptured and the 
woman might not even know she was pregnant. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy always requires 
surgical intervention. Any of the following symptoms and signs warrant an emergency situation and immediate stabilization and referral to a specialist should be sought. 
Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain
!!
Dizziness or fainting!!
Pain in the lower back!!
Pain in the shoulders (due to leakage of blood into the abdomen affecting the !!
diaphragm)
Cold clammy skin, rapid thready pulse indicating hypovolemic shock!!
In every case involving the above symptoms in a pregnant woman, you should suspect ruptured 
ectopic pregnancy and refer to the Community Health Centre (CHC) or District Hospital (DH), 
whichever is nearer, by first informing the Community Health Officer (CHO).
3.4.3. Safe Transport and Referral
Refer section 3.1.3 as well as annexure II. 
3.4.4. Follow-up Care
Most cases of pregnancy related emergencies do not require extensive care after discharge 
from the health facility, for complete recovery. However, they do require follow-up care to check 
for any post-discharge complications like bleeding, loose stitches, infections etc. as well as the 
woman might be in need of emotional support. As the ASHA, you will be involved in checking for such complications during HBNC visits and informing the ANM/MPW-F for any suspected/reported complication. Your role will be to provide follow-up care and providing support to the 
woman and her family whenever required.  
3.5. New-born Emergencies 
3.5.1 Recognising life threatening situations
In a new-born or infant, the following are the signs of emergency:
Abnormally high or low body temperature!!
Drowsy, lethargic or unconscious!!
Not being able to feed or vomiting everything!!
Convulsions !!
Grunting and severe chest in-drawing!!
Fast breathing!!"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,25,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 25 3.5.2. Management Protocol
Specific Measures
In any type of new born emergencies, you should carry out ABCDE protocol, provide first-aid 
wherever possible and then the child should be referred to a facility where the presenting 
condition can be treated (Refer Annexure-II)
The most common newborn emergencies are collectively called “THE MISFITS”
T: Toxicity
H: Heart disease
E: Endocrine 
M: Metabolic (electrolyte imbalance) I: Inborn errors of Metabolism
S: SepsisF: Formula Mishaps
I: Intestinal problemsT: Trauma 
S: Seizu
res
3.5.3. Safe Transport and Referral
Apart from the referral protocol mentioned in section 3.1.3, in cases where you suspect a newborn 
emergency, you should co-ordinate with the ANM/CHO and refer the case to the appropriate 
nearest facility. 
3.5.4. Follow up care
Like you have already learnt in previous sections on follow up care, even infants who have suffered 
emergency situations could need follow-up care in order to make sure there is no complications. 
In such cases, you should educate the parents or guardians of the infant regarding wound care 
and report any complication to the ANM/CHO. 
3.5.5. Prevention at community level
Newborn emergencies could be any of the emergency conditions ranging from poisoning, burns, choking, drowning, acute abdomen, trauma, bites etc. that can be prevented by being aware and 
taking specific precautions against them. You will play an important role in raising awareness among 
community members about these emergencies and educating them regarding their prevention by targeting parents during immunization days, Village Health Nutrition Days (VHNDs) etc. 
3.6. Heart Attack, Stroke, Diabetic Emergencies
3.6.1. Recognising life threatening situations
Some of the general signs that can be considered life threatening are:
Sudden weakness in arms or legs (usually affects one side of the body)!!
Sudden drooping or weakness in one side of face!!
Sudden loss of balance, headache, dizziness or loss of consciousness!!"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,26,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres26 Sudden blurring of vision!!
Sudden difficulty in speech/inability to speak!!
Sudden pain in the chest !!
Low Blood Sugar Level High Blood Sugar Level
1. Tiredness
2. Sweating3. Mental confusion
4. Dizziness or unconsciousness
5. Headache1. Dry mouth
2. Increased thirst3. Weakness4. Headache5. Severe dehydration
6. Nausea and abdominal discomfort
7. Severely high blood sugar levels can cause coma
You shall learn more about specific emergency conditions in the section on management 
protocol.
3.6.2. Management Protocol 
(a) General Measures 
The general measures for management and prompt stabilization of emergency conditions arising out of NCDs is similar to the one you have learnt in the beginning of the chapter with 
the following exception.
The sequence of ABCDE protocol is different for cases suggestive of cardiac emergencies. When 
you are attending to a victim of cardiac emergency like cardiac arrest, the most important step 
is to allow blood to be pumped by the heart and hence, the suggested protocol for cardiac 
emergencies is CAB instead of (H) ABCDE/ABCDE. 
In addition to this, you should follow the rest of the protocols under general measures that you 
have learnt. 
(b) Specific Measures
As you have learnt earlier, the two most common NCDs – hypertension and diabetes – can lead to emergencies if not controlled. You have been trained about these complications in the module 
on non-communicable diseases. The following emergency conditions can arise as complications 
of uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes.
In NCD related emergency conditions, the most important step you must take is planning a 
proper referral. Apart from that, sometimes when you find no pulse, you will be needed to perform CPR (Annexure-I).
Stroke 
It is characterized by:
Sudden weakness in arms or legs (usually affects one side of the body)!!
Sudden drooping or weakness in one side of face!!
Sudden loss of balance, headache, dizziness or loss of consciousness!!
Sudden blurring of vision!!
Sudden difficulty in speech/inability to speak!!"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,27,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 27 A case of stroke must be immediately transferred to a tertiary care hospital.
Heart attack/cardiac arrest
It is characterized by sudden pain in the chest which may spread to left arm, difficulty in breathing 
and loss of consciousness. Sometimes a heart attack may present only as sweating, nausea, 
tiredness, tingling and numbness in the extremities.
A case of heart attack, the victim must immediately be taken to the nearest health facility. They 
may require Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) (Remember to follow CAB and not ABC). See 
Annexure I for procedure of CPR.
Diabetic emergencies: High and low sugar in the body
Patients with diabetes have high blood 
sugar levels because of the body’s 
inability to utilize the glucose. Diabetic 
patients follow a low sugar diet and take medicines which help the glucose to get utilized and thus keeps the blood sugar 
levels in check.
Diabetic emergencies arise in two 
situations:
1.	When the disease is uncontrolled (the patient does not follow 
low sugar diet or does not take 
medicines) it leads to very high 
blood sugar level.
2.	When the patient on diabetes medicine does not eat for a long time, it leads to very low blood 
sugar level.
The symptoms of high and low blood sugar levels have been given in the table in section 3.6.1. 
If a person who has a known history of diabetes shows any of these symptoms, refer him/her 
immediately to the nearest appropriate health facility.
3.6.3. Safe transport and Referral 
(Refer to section 3.1.3)
3.6.4. Follow-up Care
In cases of NCD related emergencies, the follow-up care would consist of ensuring regular 
check-ups of the patient as well as educating him/her regarding strict adherence to dietary and 
lifestyle modification advice and medications, which you along with the ANM and CHO have 
already been doing.
3.6.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
You have already been involved in generating community level awareness regarding NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, cancer etc. In addition to the work you have already been doing, you 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,28,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres28 could also consider the following key messages in order to prevent emergencies related to 
NCDs (hypertension and diabetes):
1.	All hypertensive and diabetic patients should get their blood pressure and blood sugar checked regularly, take medicines as prescribed, follow dietary advice, maintain healthy lifestyle and visit the doctor regularly. 
2.	Pregnant women with hypertension and other co-morbidities should undergo periodic monitoring of their vitals and keep family and you informed.
3.7. Exposure Illnesses
3.7.1. Heat exhaustion and heat stroke
As you are aware, India is a country of high humidity (especially in the southern coastal area) and extreme temperatures (summers in the northern states). In such conditions, heat illnesses 
are common considering long hours spent in harsh sun. Prolonged time in the sun could lead 
to dehydration (loss of water from the body) which could further cause or trigger heat illnesses. In the following section, you shall learn about the two most common heat illnesses namely heat exhaustion and heat stroke and how to help the victims of these illnesses.
What is heat exhaustion?
Heat exhaustion is basically a warning that the body is getting too hot. The body on touch will feel cold and clammy because the temperature of body as well as the pulse is normal in such 
cases. Exhaustion in simple terms means “getting tired”. Similarly, in heat exhaustion, the body is 
tired because of loss of water and salt from the body due to excessive sweating. Although heat illnesses can happen with anyone, it is more seen in elderly people. 
What is Heat Stroke?
If heat exhaustion is left untreated, it could lead to more severe symptoms causing a ‘heat stroke’. This is the most serious heat illness and is caused by body temperature rising to 104 F (40 C) or 
higher. A heat stroke would need immediate medical attention and without any delay you should 
transport the victim to the nearest appropriate facility since untreated heatstroke can quickly damage their brain, heart, kidneys and muscles. The degree of damage that a heat stroke can 
cause will depend on the height of body temperature and the amount of time spent in the sun. 
3.7.1.1. Recognising life threatening situations
Emergency conditions due to heat illnesses are common especially in extreme climatic regions. These are illnesses that occur due to prolonged exposure to high heat conditions. The symptoms 
of heat exhaustion and heat stroke are given in the table below:
Heat exhaustion Heat stroke
1. Dizziness or fainting
2. Excessive sweating3. Cool, pale and clammy skin4. Rapid and weak pulse5. Nausea or vomiting6. Muscle cramps1. Headache2. No sweating3. Red, hot and dry skin (feels like fever)4. Rapid but strong pulse5. Nausea or vomiting6. May lose consciousness"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,29,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 29 3.7.1.2. Management Protocol 
Specific Measures
In a case of heat exhaustion, assure the following:
1. Get the person to lie down in a cool place in the shade.
2. Loosen his/her clothing. 
3. Apply cool, wet cloth on the forehead, neck, arms and other exposed areas of the body. 
4. Fan the person with cool air. 
5. Give sips of water slowly.
6. If vomiting occurs, refer immediately to the nearest health facility.
In a case of heat stroke, assure the following:
1. Start cool bath or sponging to reduce body temperature. Use extreme caution.
2. Start rapid cooling until body temperature reaches 38°C (100.4°F). External cooling is most 
effective. Place patient on a cooling surface, wet the victim’s skin and dry with fan to 
optimize evaporative cooling, and place ice packs to the neck,  Cold water immersion is 
effective, but not practical. (Commonly used cooling techniques are given below).
3. Do not give fluids orally if the person is not conscious.
4. If the victim starts having fits (seizures), follow the stabilization protocol as learnt in 
section 3.9.2. 
External cooling 
What is external cooling?
It is a method that involves application of a cooling media (like cold water, ice, fanning etc.) to 
the skin, which causes removal of heat, usually resulting in a lower temperature. This type of 
cooling is important in extreme cases of heat illnesses. Some of the most commonly used cooling 
techniques are as follows:
1.  Evaporative cooling: In very simple words, this means using air to cause cooling to the victim. 
This is very similar to how we use a 
hand fan in summers. You can use any object that is available at the 
site to cause this. Most commonly 
used objects could be a magazine, papers, cloth like dupatta etc. this is one of the most acceptable and 
readily available techniques for 
cooling and is also well tolerated by victims. (Remember, in case of a heat 
stroke, the victim shall not be seen 
sweating. In this case, you should first wet the victim’s skin by splashing some water on the victim’s face and 
body and then using a hand held fan 
etc. to cause evaporative cooling) 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,30,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres30 2.  Immersive cooling: This is also a simple technique, however, it might not always be possible 
because you will need a water source, a bucket like vessel to hold the cold water etc. In cases 
where you have access to these materials, you can use this technique as it is also proven to 
be effective. The following steps are to be followed for conducting immersive technique:
Fill a vessel (a bucket preferably) with ice-cold water.!!
Dip the victim’s hands/ feet in the bucket !!
You can also dip a cloth in this water and put it on the forehead of the victim like is !!
traditionally done during fever. More frequent ice pack/cloth change and reapplication of cold water will allow for more rapid cooling. 
3.7.2. Cold exposure related illnesses (Hypothermia and Frostbite) 
Similar to heat related illnesses, some parts of the Indian terrain are also prone to cold exposure related illnesses especially in the Himalayan regions, Ladakh, Siachen, Leh, owing to extreme 
cold weather. You might have come across cases where a thumb or a toe goes numb after a long exposure to extreme cold. Any such cases should always be treated as a medical emergency. 
What is hypothermia? 
Hypothermia is a sharp fall in the body temperature, caused by prolonged exposures to very cold temperatures. The body’s temperature drops below 95° F (35° C) against a normal body 
temperature of 98.6° F (37° C). When the body temperature is dangerously low, the brain and 
body cannot function properly and hence it should always be treated as an emergency. 
What is frostbite?
Frostbite is different from hypothermia in the sense that it is more localised. It affects the body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to cold weather. Hypothermia 
affects the whole body.  A person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have hypothermia 
Frostbite can occur when skin is exposed to a temperature of 0 °C (32 °F) or lower, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resultant decrease in blood flow does not deliver sufficient heat to the tissue to prevent the formation of ice crystals. The anatomic sites most susceptible to frostbite 
include hands, feet, and exposed tissues (eg, ears, nose, and lips).
How is hypothermia different from frostbite?
Frostbite affects the body parts that are far from the heart or those with large exposed areas to 
cold weather while hypothermia affects the whole body. A person with frostbite on the arms or legs 
may also have hypothermia due to loss of body heat, causing lowering of body temperature.

3.7.2.2. Management protocol 
Specific Measures
In a case of cold exposure related illnesses, 
1. Move the victim away from the cold exposure to a warm room or shelter. 
2. You could use hot water bags/ bottles to help warm the affected area. 
3. Do not use electric warmers or other dry heating sources as these could cause burns. 
4. Do not rub or make the victim walk or use the affected body part.
5. If there are blisters, be careful to not break them or let the victim break them.
6. Remove any wet clothing the victim is wearing.
7. If the victim is conscious and alert, you could offer warm fluids like tea, warm milk or high 
energy food like chocolate etc.
8. Keep the body dried and wrapped, including their head and neck, in a warm blanket.
9. If the victim is unresponsive, on assessment, he/she may be in need of CPR or assisted 
breathing.
Note:
If you are comfortable and willing, you could use skin-to-skin contact where your own body 
heat can be used to warm the victim, in cases where you are not able to find a hot water bottle/
bag or blankets,
Caution: A victim of frostbite could often be unaware due to numbness in the skin of the affected body part. In such situations, the victim could be prone to self-harm. While stabilizing, you should 
be careful not to allow the victim to rub, scratch or massage the affected area
3.7.3. Safe transport and referral
Referral and transport is especially of prime importance if it is a case of exposure related illnesses. In such cases, you should plan a referral to the nearest appropriate health facility by keeping the 
CHO informed."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,32,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres32 3.7.4. Follow-up Care
Exposure related illnesses are mostly controlled with general measures or once treatment is 
completed and do not require follow up care for recovery. However, each case is different and if 
the MO or the CHO who treated the patient prescribes follow-up care (either due to any injuries 
or underlying disorder), you as the ASHA should help the patient maintain treatment compliance and aid in the patient’s recovery. 
3.7.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at Community Level
Generally exposure related illnesses are self-limiting and are largely preventable. The following precautionary measures can be used by you to create awareness in the community regarding 
the same. 
For heat related illnesses: 
1. Wear loose fitting, light colored clothes in summer. Always keep head covered when 
going out in the sun.
2. Avoid direct sun heat (especially during afternoon).
3. Rest in shaded places. For occupations which require working outdoors, take frequent breaks. 
4. Avoid vigorous physical activities in hot and humid weather. 
5. Drink plenty of fluids and water to stay hydrated during hot weather.
For cold exposure illnesses:
1. Wear woolen/warm multilayer clothing in winters or in areas with cold climate, adequately 
covering the extremities like feet, hands, chin, and ears. 
2. Avoid long and direct exposure to extreme cold like snow, waterbodies etc
3. Consumption of locally available foods that help in warming up the body like peanuts, ghee etc. 
4. Exercising or regular physical activity help warm up the body.
3.8. Severe Allergic Reactions
3.8.1. Recognizing life threatening situations
Even though allergies are common, sometimes, allergic 
reactions may be life-threatening. Severe allergic 
reactions can be of two types. The warning signs are 
as follows:  
In the first type, there is swelling of the lips, !!
tongue, face and throat which can lead to wheezing and difficulty in breathing. Sometimes 
swelling may also appear in the genitals, hands, 
and feet.
In the second type, the blood pressure falls 
!!
drastically leading to shock with symptoms like 
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,33,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 33 dizziness and fainting, mental confusion, weak and rapid pulse, cold and clammy skin, 
nausea and vomiting.
Sometimes mild allergic reactions may progress to severe allergy. Therefore it is also important to be cautious of mild allergic symptoms such as: 
Sneezing, itching of the nose, eyes or roof of the mouth, stuffy nose, watery, red or 
!!
swollen eyes.
Tingling sensation in the mouth particularly due to food allergens.!!
Severe itching or hives (red, very itchy, smoothly elevated areas of skin) all over the !!
body.
3.8.2. Management Protocol 
Specific Measures
The treatment for allergies is divided into two parts: History Taking and Symptomatic Treatment
History taking:
If the person is able to speak, a history of what caused the allergy should be taken so that it can 
be avoided in future. If the person is not able to speak, ask anyone who was there with him/her 
at the time the allergy began. You could ask if the cause of the allergy is any of the allergens 
mentioned in 3.8.5 that the patient might have come in contact with. If not, you should ask about 
any other substance that the patient could have been exposed to for the first time. If the person 
has had allergic reactions before, ask the person about what had caused it the previous time.
Symptomatic Treatment:
Most of the times, you will see that the person suffering from such an allergic reaction will have symptoms as we learnt in the previous chapter. Proper and timely first aid can help the patient 
from progressing into a dangerous anaphylactic shock. Sometimes, minor redness or itching can 
turn into a severe reaction within minutes and hence should not be ignored. 
In such situations, first call for help and inform the nearest appropriate public health facility as well 
as the CHO about their readiness to attend to the case. To stabilize the patient till help arrives:
1. Lay the patient flat with legs raised
2. Reassure the patient
3. Loosen any tight clothing 
4. Apply a cool, damp cloth on the hives, if present, to soothe the itching
5. Move the patient to the shade since heat could worsen the symptoms
Caution:
Do not allow the patient to stand or walk!!
Do not place them in seated, standing, or upright position!!
Do not give any other medicine!!
Do not give any food or water to the patient if he/she is breathless or unconscious!!"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,34,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres34 3.8.3. Safe transport and Referral
If you recognise the situation of the patient to be life-threatening based on the presenting 
symptoms, you should first call for help and inform the nearest appropriate public health facility 
as well as the CHO about their readiness to attend to the case.
Refer section 3.1.4.
3.8.4. Follow up Care
Follow up care is of importance when it comes to patients who have had an allergic reaction 
earlier. The care that the patient will need post treatment is not related to treatment, but it is 
actually to prevent further incidences as this one. 
In case of Anaphylaxis/Severe Allergic Reactions, you could help the person identify the allergen 
(substance that caused the allergy) through a thorough history taking, and educate him/her to 
avoid the identified allergen from then onwards. This information can also come handy in case 
the situation repeats.  
3.8.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
An Allergy is a condition where our body reacts to a foreign substance in the body which could either be inhaled or ingested. This reaction usually causes symptoms in the nose, throat, ears, 
skin and stomach. An allergic reaction usually starts within a few minutes. Some of these foreign substances include but is not limited to the following:
Airborne allergens 
!! such as pollen, animal dander, dust mites and mould
Certain food !! particularly peanuts, wheat, fish, shellfish, eggs and milk
Insect stings !! such as from a bee or wasp
Medications !! particularly penicillin or penicillin-based antibiotics
Latex or other substances you touch !! which can cause allergic skin reactions
What could cause allergy in one person may not cause allergy in another, in the sense that 
allergens could be unique to individuals and hence it is difficult to identify the allergen unless the 
individual is exposed to it. This is why history taking is extremely important. 
3.9. Seizures/Fits 
3.9.1. Recognising life threatening situations 
Fits (convulsions/seizures) can occur due to many underlying medical causes, in both adults and children. In case of a person suffering from fits, assure the following:
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,35,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 35 Identify whether the fits are affecting the entire body (Generalized) or some parts (Focal)
a. Generalized fits involves shaking of the whole body (the person is on the floor and 
vigorously shaking, he/she may appear confused or may lose consciousness).
b. Focal fits involves only some parts of the body (the person may have repetitive movements like chewing/blinking or rhythmic twitching of any body part.
3.9.2. Management Protocol 
If the patient before you is having fits, you should not do anything that restricts their movements. However, you should make sure that they do not hurt themselves during the 
fits episode due to any obstacles in the way. You can follow the below mentioned steps to 
ensure the same: 
1. Keep surrounding safe (eg. keep pillows to avoid injury from surrounding objects, remove 
any objects in the way that can injure the patient further).
2. Place a clean cloth between the teeth of the patient so that he/she does not bite the tongue.
3. Place patient in recovery position after the fits stop.
Caution 
Do not attempt to hold the person’s mouth open.!!
Do not hold the person down or try to stop his/her movements or restrain his/her arms/!!
legs tightly
Do not offer the person water or food until he/she is fully alert.!!
3.9.3. Safe transport and Referral 
As you learnt in the management protocol, you should never restrict the movements of the 
person who is having fits. Hence, you should also not move or transport the person while the 
person is having seizures. Call for help as soon as you attend the patient and keep CHO informed 
about the referral. A person experiencing a seizures, needs to be referred to a facility that has availability of a CT scan. 
Remember that you should move or transport the patient only when the person has stopped 
seizures and movements are stable. 
3.9.4. Follow up Care
Patients of epilepsy or fits generally require long-term follow-up care especially if the root cause of the epilepsy has not yet been diagnosed. For this, a thorough history taking is extremely 
important followed by investigations. Hence, when you attend to a patient who is having fits, you 
should be very observant as it will help in a proper history and diagnosis.
Once the diagnosis has been established, the patient might require help in terms of treatment 
compliance, side effects of the treatment medications etc which you could help with during home 
visits. You could also undertake educating the family regarding the condition so that the patient receives the necessary support. You should also make sure that the patient as well as the family is aware of the specifications of the disorder, the medications, the possible side-effects with the 
medication, recurrence etc. "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,36,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres36 Any recurring episode needs to be reported to the CHO so that appropriate treatment can be 
done. In case the person develops permanent disability, ensure that he/she receives appropriate 
palliative care. Link him/her with the palliative care services provided through the AB-HWC and 
provide psycho-social support to help the person overcome the crisis.
5.9.5. Prevention and awareness Generation at the Community Level
Lack of awareness regarding epilepsy or seizures at the community level acts as a barrier in providing treatment and care in the community. Not all seizures are preventable but seizures 
that occur as a result of trauma from accidents, stroke or other heart diseases, infections, and 
maternity related events can be prevented to certain extent. You as the ASHA, could make the community aware regarding the causes of epilepsy that are preventable as well as about the treatment options available.
Some key messages that you can make use of in the community are
Encouraging immunization for every individual in the community (so as to protect the 
!!
community from preventable infections)
Ensuring pregnant women to receive proper ANC!!
Generating awareness regarding safety measures to avoid head injuries!!
Promoting healthy lifestyle in order to avoid stroke and other heart diseases.!!
5.10. Choking
Even though choking is more common in children, it can also happen in adults. The object on 
which the victim has choked, might block the throat. In such cases, the victim might have difficulty 
in breathing or talking and sometimes the skin might turn blue. 
5.10.1. Recognizing life threatening situations
In some cases, choking can be life-threatening since the object the victim is choking on could 
cut off airway giving the brain limited oxygen. The brain can only function without oxygen for few 
minutes and this is why it is important to attend to the victim of choking as soon as possible. A 
person who’s choking may cough continuously until they expel the food or liquid from their throat or airway. However, in some cases, the object, food, or liquid gets stuck in the throat and cuts off the air supply. Some of the signs to identify if the case is life-threatening and needs emergency 
care are following:
The victim is unable to speak, cough, make noise or breathe
!!
Bluish tint to the lips, skin, or nails from a lack of oxygen!!
5.10.2. Management Protocol
Specific Measures: 
The object on which the victim has choked, might block the throat. In such cases, the victim might 
have difficulty in breathing or talking and sometimes the skin might turn blue. 
The tables given below shows how to manage a case of choking. Either technique can be used.
For an adult:"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,37,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 37 Step 1 Reassure the person.
Step 2 Bend him/her forwards so that the head is lower than the chest.
Step 3 Encourage him/her to cough if possible.
Step 4 Give up to five sharp blows on the back 
between shoulder blades with the flat of your hands. When to slap back when to compress the bell?
OR
Step 1 Stand behind the victim and 
put both arms round the upper part of his/her abdomen. If the choking patient is a child, position yourself to the correct height. If the choking patient is a pregnant woman, place your arms below the chest and above the level of the abdomen.
Step 2 Lean the victim forward.
Step 3 Clench your fist and place it between the umbilicus (navel) and the bottom of 
sternum (breast bone).
Step 4 Grasp this hand with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and upwards.
Step 5 Repeat up to five times.
For a small child: 
Step 1 Place the child over your knee
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,38,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres38 Step 2 Slap him on the back between shoulder blades using less force than for 
an adult. Use the heel of one hand to give up to 5 back slaps between the baby’s shoulder blades.
For a baby:
Step 1 Lay the baby along your forearm
Step 2 Slap him on the back between shoulder blades using less force than for a child. 
Use the heel of one hand to give up to 5 back slaps between the baby’s shoulder blades.
Note: If the choking patient is unconscious, do not attempt these techniques. Look for and 
remove the foreign body ONLY if it is visible. Refer to the hospital immediately.
3.10.3. Safe transport and Referral 
Refer section 3.1.3
3.10.4. Follow up Care
Generally the hazards from choking are short-lived and do not require post-treatment. However, as the ASHA, you could visit the victim post-treatment along with the ANM to track any 
complications. 
3.10.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at Community Level
Children or even adults usually choke from objects that they have accidentally ingested. 
However, they may also choke when eating too quickly or when talking/laughing with food in 
their mouths, inhaling smoke (choking on the soot of the smoke) etc. As the ASHA, you can 
help create awareness in the community regarding prevention of choking accidents using the following messages:
1. Do not leave infants and small children unattended around toys or other small objects like coins, bottle caps, batteries etc.
2. Stay alert while eating or drinking. Supervise small children while they eat or drink. Educate parents to discourage their children talking/laughing while eating or eating too fast etc. 
3. Making it a habit to always keep water next to oneself while eating. 
4. Educate community on how to relive obstruction due to choking. Can be taught to volunteers, school kids, etc"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,39,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 39 3.11. Poisoning
3.11.1. Recognizing life-threatening situations
Poisoning can be caused by substances that are easily available both inside and outside 
the house. Cases of poisoning can be both accidental and intentional. However, irrespective 
of the cause and intention, you as the ASHA, should always report cases of poisoning to 
the CHO and provide prompt stabilization and facilitate referral of the victim to appropriate nearest facility. 
The effects of poisoning depend on the substance, amount, and type of contact as well as the 
age, weight, and state of health of the victim. 
Possible symptoms of poisoning include:
Nausea and/or vomiting
!!
Diarrhoea!!
Rash!!
Redness or sores around the mouth!!
Dry mouth!!
Drooling or foaming at the mouth!!
Trouble breathing!!
Dilated pupils (bigger than normal) or constricted pupils (smaller than normal)!!
Confusion!!
Fainting!!
Shaking or seizures!!
3.11.2. Management Protocol
Specific Measures 
A person who has ingested or inhaled poisonous substance should be immediately stabilized 
and referred to the nearest appropriate health facility as soon as possible. Reassure the person. 
Rinse mouth of the person with water in case of ingested poison and move him/her to a place 
with adequate ventilation so that he/she gets fresh air to breathe, in case of inhaled poison.
Caution
Do not make the person vomit.!!
Do not make the person eat or drink anything.!!
3.11.3. Safe Transport and Referral
Refer 3.1.3. 
3.11.4. Follow-up Care
Refer 3.1.4."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,40,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres40 3.11.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
Cases of poisoning are largely preventable and the best way to do that is to avoid contact with 
harmful substances. 
You can use the following messages to create awareness in the community regarding the 
prevention of poisoning: 
Keep all household substances out of the reach of children. You should put them in high !!
or locked cabinets. 
Wear protective clothing, like gloves, when you use cleaners and chemicals.!!
If you use chemicals inside the house, keep the area well aired.!!
Do not mix chemicals as mixed chemicals could become poisonous. !!
Keep medicines and chemicals in their original containers and label every such !!
container. Get rid of old or expired medicines and household products. 
!!
Do not drink spurious liquor.!!
3.12. Near-Drowning
3.12.1. Recognizing life-threatening situations
Even though we use the word “drowning” commonly to refer to suffocation from water entering 
the nose and mouth of a person, the correct word to be used is “near-drowning” which means 
almost dying from suffocating under water. This is the stage where emergency care is needed to 
save the victim’s life.
A victim of near-drowning could most probably be unresponsive which you will learn when you 
conduct AVPU.  The other signs that are life-threatening are:
Cold or bluish skin!!
Abdominal swelling!!
Chest pain!!
Cough!!
Vomiting!!
No breathing!!
Erratic breathing!!
No pulse!!
Nail beds, slow or no circulation!!
Mouth, nose or skin turning blue!!
3.12.2. Management Protocol
AVPU and ABCDE are extremely important in cases of near-drowning as the victim might be 
unresponsive on assessment and may be in need of CPR or assisted breathing."
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,41,"Management and Prevention of Common Emergency Conditions 41 When you Check for ABCDE in a victim of near-drowning, you could follow the below mention 
approach: 
Check for the victim’s breathing
(Use look, listen, feel) Look for visible movement of chestListen for breathing soundFeel the victim’s pulseBreathing If no spinal injury, Put the victim in recovery positionCover the victim in warm  
blanket- keep victim warm
Observe
Not Breathing No Pulse
DO CPR
Specific Measures
In a case of near-drowning, you could undertake the following measures:
Remove the victim from water immediately!!
Assess for breathing. If the victim is breathing, then place him/her in recovery position. !!
If the victim is not breathing or moving, then he/she might require Cardio-Pulmonary 
Resuscitation (CPR) (As shown in the previous section)
Be very careful when handling the victim and performing CPR, as the individual could !!
have a neck or spinal injury. Do not move or turn their neck or head. Stabilize the neck by 
manually holding the head and neck in place or placing towels or other objects around 
the neck to support it.
Remove wet clothes and cover the victim with a blanket to prevent hypothermia (support !!
the neck while removing the victim’s clothes)
Remove any visible foreign body, weed, sand or mud from the mouth!!
Transfer the victim to the appropriate nearest health facility immediately.!!

3.12.5. Prevention and Awareness Generation at the Community Level
1. Do not leave infants and small children unattended around water bodies.
2. Do not leave vessels filled with water uncovered around small infants and children, eg. 
Buckets, drums, gamla, etc.
3. Avoiding alcohol consumption while driving or boating or playing near water bodies

CPR in adults
Step 1 Kneel by the side of the victim
Step 2 Place the heel of one 
hand in the centre of victim’s chest.
Step 3 Place the heel of your 
other hand on top of the first hand.
Step 4 Interlock the fingers 
of your hands and ensure that pressure is not applied over the victim’s ribs.
"
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,43,"Annexures 43 Step 5 Position yourself 
vertically above the victim’s chest and with your arms straight, press down on the sternum 4-5 cm
Step 6 After each compression release all the pressure on the chest without losing contact 
between your hands and sternum.
Step 7 Repeat at the rate of minimum 100-120 compressions per minute (a little less than 2 compression a second).
Step 8 Compression and Release should take equal amount of time.
Combine chest compressions with rescue breaths
After 30 compressions give mouth to mouth breathing to the victim.
Give a total of two rescue breaths and the return your hands without delay to the correct position 
on the sternum and give a further 30 chest compressions.
Continue with chest compression and recue breaths in a ratio of 30:2.
Stop to recheck the victim only if he starts breathing normally; otherwise do not interrupt 
resuscitation.
Only CPR
If you are unable or not willing to give rescue breaths, give hands only CPR.
If chest compressions only are given these should be continuous at the rate of 100 per 
minute.
Stop to recheck the victim only if he starts breathing normally; otherwise do not interrupt 
resuscitation.
Two-person CPR
If there are two trained personnel (rescuers) present at the scene, CPR is conducted by both persons in turns. They should coordinate to perform chest compressions. If the rescuers 
performing CPR are unable or not willing to give rescue breaths, hands only CPR should 
be done.
In the two-person CPR, rescuers switch positions after about every two minutes. One of the 
rescuers is positioned near the chest area and gives chest compressions while the other one "
Emergency Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,44,"Training Manual on Management of Common Emergencies, Burns and Trauma for ASHA  
at Ayushman Bharat- Health and Wellness Centres44 is positioned near the head of the victim and gives after every 30 compressions. This position 
allows quick position changing.
Switching regularly and quickly ensures that the depth and the rate of compressions are adequate. 
The two-person CPR method allows rescuers to continue performing CPR for hours until medical help arrives.
Indications to start chest compressions in infants (or children)
When no define pulse is palpable in 5-10 seconds.!!
When pulse rate is less than 60 beats/minute.!!
CPR in Children
The adult sequence may also be used for children but following minor modifications in the sequence will make it more suitable for use in children:
1.	Give initial rescue breaths before starting chest compressions.
2.	If you are on your own perform CPR for approximately one minute before going for help.
3.	Use one or two hands as needed for a child over one year to achieve adequate depth of compression (about 2 inches) at the rate of at least 120 per minute, at the centre of the chest.
4.	Tilt the head back and listen for breathing. If not breathing normally, pinch nose and cover the mouth with yours and blow until you see the chest rise. Each breath should take 1 second.
Caution: Breaths can be omitted during pandemic times and hands-only CPR may be performed.
CPR in Infants
For checking the pulse in infant, brachial pulse is preferred –it can be felt in the middle of upper arm on the medial side. CPR even if HR is <60. 
1.	Identify inter-mammary line
2.	Press with two fingers just below the centre of the inter-mammary line.
3. Compress chest by 1/3 to 1/2 of the depth of the chest (about one and a half inches). Give 
15 gentle chest compressions at the rate of at least 120 per minute.
4.	Open the airway using a head tilt lifting of chin. Do not tilt the head too far back.
5.	If the baby is not breathing or not breathing normally, cover the baby’s mouth and nose with your mouth and give 2 gentle breaths. Each breath should be 1 second long. You 
should see the baby’s chest rise with each breath.
Caution: Breaths can be omitted during pandemic times and hands-only CPR may be performed.

Ayushman Bharat Bharat Program looks at a comprehensive primary health care package 
of services at all levels and this approach has been initiated in the country. One of the new 
service areas that has been initiated in Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centres is Ear, 
Nose and Throat care (ENT care).
ENT takes care of three senses of the body – hearing, smell, and taste. It also has one of the most 
important set of organs in the body that connects the external environment to the internal body, 
through the ear, nose and throat.
Problems associated with these organs and related areas can cause a lot of health problems and 
disabilities in any person. Someone who has deafness problem will have great difficulty in integrating 
into society. The conditions related to the nose and throat area can lead to dangerous infections and 
cancers.
As an ASHA, you are a very important member of the Health and Wellness Centre team and are 
closest to the community. Therefore, you have a significant role in helping the health team in 
screening, referring, monitoring, and in health promotion activities. This also applies to problems 
associated with the ear, nose and throat.
This module will act as a guide to help you identify various common ENT conditions, determine 
what to do in these situations, and how to make people aware of what they can do to prevent these 
conditions. CHAPTER 01"

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,7,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES7Structure
The ear is made up of 3 parts:
Outer ear – earlobe and ear canal- ends with 
a cover called the ear drum
Middle ear – is a closed box like structure 
– starts from the ear drum and contains 3 
small bones attached to each other. 
Inner ear – the inside most part of the ear 
which has the hearing centre called the 
cochlea and the balance canals called the 
semi-circular canals..   
How does the ear function?
Sound waves enter the ear through the ear lobe and ear canal and hit the ear drum. These cause the 
ear drum to vibrate. The vibrations cause the small bones to carry the sound to the cochlea in the 
inner ear. These send a message to the brain which then resends a message explaining the sound.UNDERSTANDING THE EAR

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,8,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES81. WAX
 This is a common situation where some of the secretions in the ear canal harden after contact 
with dust and other outside particles and forms a soft substance called wax. Usually, there 
is always a little wax in the ear canal. But if it increases in amount or gets hard, it can cause 
reduction in hearing and a feeling of discomfort that something is in the ear canal.. 
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Dark brown mass seen in ear 
canal;
Decreased hearing, blocking 
of ear with pain in ear.Sodium bicarbonate ear drops 2-3 drops thrice daily for 4 
days. This will help to soften the wax.
Tab Paracetamol for the pain as required.
Once the wax is soft, it can be cleaned with the cotton wick.
Do not use ear buds. If the wax does not come out, then you-
must refer the person to the SHC-HWC.
2. FURUNCLE
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Small boil in ear canal;
Pulling the earlobe outwards
causes pain;
Bursting of the boil may lead
to pus discharge.Cap Amoxicillin 500mg thrice daily for 5 days (this is an
antibiotic that only a doctor can prescribe).
Tab Paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily for 5 days.
3. FOREIGN BODY IN EAR  
 This condition is seen mainly in children where they put small objects into the ear. It is harmful 
since it might rupture the ear drum and lead to infections and problems in hearing.
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
History of foreign body 
insertion;
Mild pain present;
Blocking sensation in ear;
Bleeding may be present if
the ear canal is injured.If foreign body is visible & obvious and can be easily removed 
it may be attempted in consultation with ANM/CHO.
Else, refer to CHO at SHC-HWC who will refer the patient to 
ENT surgeon in District Hospital/ Medical College Hospital.COMMON EAR PROBLEMS

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,9,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES94. OTITIS EXTERNA
 This is an infection of the outer ear canal. It can be seen more often in those who swim or 
do not maintain good personal hygiene.  
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Severe pain in ear on 
movement of ear lobe;
Redness/ swelling of ear 
canal with crusts;
Sometimes there is 
discharge from ear.Clean ear with cotton wick (not ear bud).
Refer to the SHC-HWC for further diagnosis and treatment.
Follow up to ensure that the person is taking treatment 
correctly.
Avoid swimming till the ear pain is completely gone and the 
infection is cleared.
5. ACUTE SUPPURATIVE OTITIS MEDIA
 This is an infection of the middle ear where there is pus formation and swelling inside the middle 
ear. In many cases the ear drum also has a hole in it because of the pressure from the middle 
ear. Then there will be ear discharge.. 
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Severe pain in ear and 
deafness;
High-grade fever;
When mucopurulent 
discharge starts from the 
ear, then there is relief in 
pain.Keep the ear dry at all times.
Do not apply drops, oil, water etc.
Give a Tab. Paracetamol for pain.
Refer to the SHC-HWC for further diagnosis and treatment.
Follow up all cases that have been started on treatment.
Check that there is no ear discharge.
Explain to the patient how to keep the ear clean at all times.
6. CHRONIC SUPPURATIVE OTITIS MEDIA 
 In this case, there is discharge from the ear which is for more than 2 weeks or 14 days. It could 
be watery or pus discharge. It can get complicated and then increase in amount and have a bad 
smell. This condition can lead to deafness if not treated. 
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Chronic Ear Discharge > 14 
days;
Watery or pus discharge 
from the ear;
Reduced hearing;
If complicated, then the 
discharge becomes foul 
smelling and the patient will 
complain of headache and 
fever.2% boric spirit ear drops 2 drops thrice daily for 7 days after 
dry mopping of ear with cotton wick.
Keep ear dry and avoid pond/river bath.
Follow-up the treatment given by Medical Officer for 
associated infections of pharynx/ nose/sinuses.
Refer all complicated cases immediately to the ENT Surgeon 
at the District Hospital."
ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,10,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES107. HEARING LOSS/ 
REDUCED HEARING
 Reduced hearing or loss 
of hearing (deafness) is a 
condition where the person 
is not able to hear anything 
or can hear only loud 
sounds. Hearing loss may 
affect persons of any age 
group.
 Some babies are born 
with deafness (known 
as congenital deafness) 
which happens when the mother is exposed to certain infections, medicines or radiation during 
pregnancy.
 As people grow old they slowly lose their hearing, usually after 65 years of age, due to 
physiological ageing process and this is called presbycusis.
 Sometimes children and adults may also lose their hearing completely or partially due to various 
causes, like an injury causing rupture of the eardrum, severe infection of the ear, tumour in 
the ear, sudden exposure to very loud sounds (like explosions) or prolonged exposure to loud 
sounds (like people working in factories with noise from heavy machinery).
 Untreated hearing loss affects communication and thus may also contribute to social isolation 
and loss of autonomy. Not being able to hear properly is often associated with anxiety and 
depression. Hearing loss in children can affect their growing up, education, interaction with 
others and personality development. Hearing loss in old age can impair the quality of life.
 It is, therefore, very important to identify the people with hearing loss in the community and 
refer them to the CHO at the SHC-HWC. Since most of the diagnosis and treatment requires a 
specialist, the CHO and team will confirm the hearing loss by detailed examination of the person 
and then refer him/her to the centre where there is an ENT specialist. Hearing loss is treated 
either by surgery or by prescription of hearing aids.. 
 Your role in management of hearing loss:
1. Fill out the assessment of ‘Difficulty in hearing’ in Part B of the Community Based 
Assessment Checklist.
2. If anybody complains of reduced hearing, inform the ANM and refer to the CHO at 
SHCHWC.
3. Follow up with the person after he/she returns from the referral centre. If surgery is 
advised, ensure that the person gets the surgery done.
4. If hearing aid has been prescribed, follow up for regular use and ask if the person is 
comfortable.

CHAPTER 04
1. SIMPLE VIRAL RHINITIS
 This is the most common complaint in the community. It is known as the common cold and is an 
infection. Almost every person has had an episode of common cold. It occurs in every person. 
It is very contagious and spreads through sneezing, coughing or through sharing handkerchief, 
etc. It usually resolves on its own in 5 to 7 days. If it happens too often, then one needs to find 
out the cause. 
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Watery nasal discharge;
Watering from eyes;
Nasal stuffiness;
Malaise, fever and head -
ache.Tab Paracetamol 500 mg as required.
Steam inhalation.
Tab Chlorpheniramine 4mg twice daily if there is no relief or if 
cold or allergy persists.
Advise rest and drinking plenty of fluids.
2. ALLERGIC RHINITIS
 With symptoms similar to that of a cold, the cause is usually some kind of allergy – to dust, 
pollution or specific objects, food etc. This watering from the nose, and eyes, along with sneezing 
is usually more in the early morning. 
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Watery nasal discharge;
Frequent bouts of sneezing 
about 10 to 20 sneezes at a 
single time;
Blockage of nose, Palatal 
itching;
Watering from eyes with 
redness & itching.Tab Chlorpheniramine 4 mg twice daily for 15 days.
Steam inhalation.
Avoid dust and known allergens.
3. ATROPHIC RHINITIS
 This is a more serious kind of infection and involves a pus kind of discharge from the nose 
which has a foul smell. In this situation, the patient must be referred to the Medical Officer in 
the PHC to diagnose and initiate antibiotic treatment.. "
ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,12,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES12What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Greenish crusts present in
nasal cavity;
Foul smell from nose and 
patient not aware of it;
Nasal blockage, roomy 
nasal cavity, nasal 
deformity, history of 
maggots.Nasal washing with sodium bicarbonate solution (1 tsp. in 250 
ml. distilled water) 2 – 3 times a day which is to be continued.
Refer this person to the SHC-HWC for further confirmation and 
treatment. If antibiotics are required, the CHO will consult the 
MO at the PHC.
You can give the following advice to patients with rhinitis:
1. Drink plenty of water and get enough rest.
2. Sniff a little salt water into the nose 
or breathe steam from hot water to 
clear the nose.
3. No special diet is needed. However, 
eating oranges, tomatoes, and 
other fruit containing vitamin C 
may help.
4. Do not take antibiotics if not 
prescribed.
5. Contrary to popular belief, colds do 
not come from getting cold or wet 
(although getting very cold, wet, or 
tired can make a cold worse).
6. A cold is ‘caught’ from others who 
have the infection and sneeze the 
virus into the air.
7. To keep from giving his cold to others, the sick person should eat and sleep separately, and 
take special care to stay far away from small babies. He should cover his nose and mouth 
when he coughs or sneezes and wash his hands often if possible.
8. Simple medicine such as Paracetemol helps lower temperature and relieves body aches 
and headaches. More expensive ‘cold tablets’ are not recommended.
9. Wipe a runny or stuffy nose, but try not to blow it. Blowing the nose may lead to earache 
and sinus infections..
4. SINUSITIS
 There are big spaces called sinuses behind the forehead above the eyebrows and on both sides 
of the nose. These spaces are usually filled with air and are useful to provide air and resonance 
to sounds. When the lining of these spaces gets affected, usually because of infection, then it 
causes fluid to fill up the sinuses. This can turn into pus and become a painful condition. 
"
ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,13,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES13What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Headache, blocked nose, 
purulent nasal discharge;
Pain over the sinus area 
– forehead above the 
eyebrows, or on either side 
of the nose.Steam inhalation 2-3 times a day.
Refer to the SHC-HWC for confirmation and treatment by the 
CHO.
If the person requires antibiotics, the CHO will consult the MO\ 
at the PHC and initiate.
5. EPISTAXIS (NOSE BLEED) 
 Epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is a common complaint, especially during summer. In 
majority of cases, nosebleeds are self-limiting and spontaneous, but it may be of significant 
concern if it occurs repeatedly, there is heavy bleeding or if it occurs in children. It usually occurs 
as a result of injury by fingernails, due to cold weather or in rhinitis. Sometimes it occurs in 
people who have other diseases like high blood pressure, or in case of tumours inside the nose. 
Epistaxis may also be a result of trauma to the nose..
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
Bleeding from the nose;
Pain if there is injuryImmediate relief can be obtained by tilting the head forward 
and pinching the nostrils together for 10 minutes. If it continues 
bleeding, pinch nostrils together for 10 more minutes. If no relief 
then inform ANM and refer to CHO at SHC-HWC.
In adults/elderly persons, the blood pressure also needs to 
be measured and if high then medicines need to be given in 
consultation with MO at PHC (ANM/ CHO will do this).
If the bleeding is severe or the person is gasping/choking in blood, 
or is unconscious, inform CHO and ANM and call an ambulance for 
urgent referral.
6. FOREIGN BODY IN THE NOSE
 Sometimes some foreign object may enter the nose either accidentally, or children may insert 
objects into their nose. This is very dangerous since it can result in difficulty in breathing and 
may even be aspirated into the airway.
What it is Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)
History of foreign body
insertion;
Pain in nose, headache;
Breathlessness;
Blocking sensation in 
nose;
Bleeding may be present 
if the nostril is injured.If foreign body is visible and obvious and can be easily removed it 
may be attempted in consultation with ANM/CHO.
Else refer to CHO at SHC-HWC who will refer the patient to ENT 
surgeon in District Hospital/Medical College Hospital."

1. APHTHOUS ULCERS
 This is a very painful condition when one can see some small reddish patch wounds in the cheek 
or on the tongue. Because of its situation, it causes a lot of pain and difficulty in swallowing and 
eating. The ulcers usually heal on their own in 5-7 days.
Signs and Symptoms Management at your level (in consultation with ANM/CHO)

AND PREVENTION OF ENT 
PROBLEMSCHAPTER 06
Most conditions of the ear, nose and throat are preventable. It is important to create awareness 
among the community members regarding harmful practices which can lead to diseases 
of the ear, nose and throat. Here are some common risk factors of these diseases:
Risk factors for diseases of the ear:
1.  Cleaning ear canal with sharp objects like hairpins, toothpicks, etc.
2.  Applying oil or any liquid inside the ear.
3.  Applying unprescribed medication inside the ear.
4.  Using dirty cloth or towel to clean ears.
5.  Swimming in dirty water.
6.  Leaving cotton wool or other material inside the ear for prolonged period.
7.  Getting exposed to very loud noise for prolonged period or regularly.
8.  Untreated infection of the ear for a prolonged period.
9.  Injury to the ear leading to rupture of eardrum.
Risk factors for diseases of the nose:
1.  Inserting sharp objects inside nasal cavity for cleaning.
2.  Using dirty cloth or towel to clean the nose.
3.  Picking of nose.
4.  Injury to the nose might make one predisposed to infections.
Risk factors for diseases of throat:
1.  Exposure to cold climate.
2.  Exposure to allergens like pollen, cotton dust, wood shavings, etc.
3.  Chewing tobacco/paan/gutka, smoking.
You must advise people in the community to maintain hygiene of the ear, nose and throat. Here are 
some messages that you can give in the community."
ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,17,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES17HOW TO MAINTAIN EAR HYGIENE
NOTE:
 ONLY use medicine given by the nurse or doctor at the clinic/hospital and take the correct 
dosage.
 If the ears are painful or have pus running out of them, send the person to the clinic or hospital. 
This means the ears are infected and need to be treated by the nurse or other health worker or 
a doctor.
Personal Hygiene
DO NOT put dirty fingers in ears, wash 
hands before working with food and do 
not eat with dirty hand ALWAYS wash 
your hands after going the toiletDO NOT swim or wash in dirty water
NOTE : Teach children NOT to put 
anything in their ears - seeds, beads,

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,18,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES18HOW TO MAINTAIN NASAL HYGIENE
General points for advice during community visit:
1. Always use handkerchief/clean cloth for cleaning nasal secretion.
2. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, remember to wash your 
hands with soap and water after coughing or sneezing.
3. Maintain a little distance (one arm distance) while sneezing, cleaning nose in public or around 
people.
4. Never put fingers in your nostril, it might cause bleeding from nose (epistaxis), as nose is a very 
vascular organ.
5.  Always consult doctor during the time of illness, it may rapidly infect other family members and 
might be serious for small children.
6. Avoid steam inhalation whenever there is history of nose bleeding
Steam inhalation is beneficial and one of the common home remedies used in our country. But
there is some caution to be taken:
1.  Never leave children alone for it, they might get burns.
2.  Never come too close to hot water bowl.
3.  Take vapours both from nose and mouth.

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,19,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES19
Many people complain that they have 
an irritation in the throat. It feels like 
something is scratching the throat. 
Cough is rare and dry. They don’t have pain, but 
their voice can get hoarse.. 
There are many causes of irritation – it can be 
due to bacteria or viral germs. It could also be 
because of allergies to dust. Many a times, it is 
due to gastric acidity which causes reflux into 
the throat. 
How to reduce irritation that triggers coughing:
1. Drink lots of fluids:  The most important 
thing you can do is to drink plenty of water 
to reduce dryness of your throat. Drink at 
least 1 and a half litres of water each day, 
that is about 6-8 glasses of water. Avoid 
tea, coffee or soft drinks as they usually 
contain caffeine..
2. Breathing:
a. a. Sit and stand with good posture – 
that is, neck and back straight and your 
chin gently tucked in. This opens your 
airway, makes breathing easier and 
allows you to relax the throat.
b. Breathe through your nose. Mouth 
breathing dries your throat. Breathing 
through your nose cleans, warms and 
moistens the air before it reaches your 
throat and vocal cords..
3. Talking:
a. Limit harmful voice use, such as 
shouting, grunting, or screaming. Talking, laughing or singing too loudly 
can also damage your vocal cords.
b.  Try not to speak over other noise 
such as television or music or around 
machinery.
c. Do not whisper, as whispering 
increases air pressure in your vocal 
cords and may irritate your throat. 
d. Use your natural voice, not too high, 
not too low or not too loud.
e. Limit coughing and clearing your 
throat. Sometimes coughing can be 
excessive and clearing the throat can 
become a habit. When you cough and 
clear your throat it puts too much force 
on your throat and vocal cords..
4. Everyday
a. Avoid chewing tobacco/paan/gutka, 
and smoking cigarette/bidi, etc 
b. Limit intake of caffeine containing 
drinks as caffeine can increase dryness 
and irritation in the throat.
c. Do not smoke, avoid smoky 
environment, and do not drink alcohol. 
It also increases the likelihood of 
heartburn, which can also damage the 
throat and vocal cords.
d. Do not use mouthwash that contains 
alcohol as this will dry your throat.
e. Remember to drink plenty of water 
every day.HOW TO

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,20,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES20People with hearing loss are often left out 
in the community. It is necessary to make 
the community aware of how to help 
people with hearing loss. You must encourage 
them to take the person with hearing loss to 
have their ears examined and tested.
Public awareness campaigns could create a 
better understanding of hearing loss and the 
disability that it causes:
 Local clinics could display posters/pictures 
about hearing loss and ear care to raise 
awareness amongst the patients.
 Communities should be encouraged to 
have a ‘Healthy Ear Day’ to raise awareness 
in the community.
 Visit schools and talk to teachers and 
learners about hearing loss, and its causes 
and effects. They should encourage 
activities such as designing posters to 
raise awareness and playing “What can 
you hear?” games to find out if any of the 
children may have a hearing loss. Tell teachers about hearing loss and 
encourage them to include this in their 
teaching programme.
 Explain to teachers what to look for in 
children with hearing loss and refer the 
children with possible hearing loss for 
treatment.
 Encourage people with hearing loss to have 
their ears checked and their hearing tested.
 Raise awareness in the community by 
speaking to social, religious and other 
groups about hearing loss.
 Encourage parents and teachers to use 
sign language with deaf and hard of hearing 
children
 Encourage the inclusion of hearing-impaired 
people in the workplace, in education and in 
society. 
 Encourage and support hearing impaired 
people to form support groups for 
themselves and their families.

ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,21,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES21Ineearlier chapters, you have learnt about your specific role related to several disease conditions of 
the ear, nose and throat. In this chapter, you will learn what tasks are expected of you in primary 
ENT care services. You will now learn about services available at referral facilities and role of 
different service providers. You will find that many points that have been highlighted are repeated 
here, but this will help you to understand and plan your day-to-day work.
Service delivery framework for providing care for ENT related disorders
As you know, provision of health care services to the community is a teamwork. You would need to 
know about the roles of other team members – ANM/MPW, CHO, PHC team and service providers 
at secondary care facility in order to provide right information to the community members. 
What are the roles of other members of Primary Health Care team at SHC-HWC?
1. MPW : They will have a role in outreach as well as in SHC/SHC-HWC based activities. They will 
provide you with support and monitor all your activities along with the ASHA facilitator. Support 
you in completion of CBAC forms either through joint visits or providing clarifications regarding the 
checklist. If you have recognized any hearing loss/ reduced hearing in an individual through CBAC, 
you will refer them to SHC-HWC for further screening and referral for deafness. MPW/ANM will 
provide support to CHO for effectively carrying out all the activities related to ENT care. Along with 
the ASHA Facilitator, she will help in providing community-based rehabilitation, social acceptance 
and vocational training and inclusive education for hearing-impaired patients.
2. Community Health Officer: The Primary Health Care team will be led by a Community Health 
Officer (CHO) at SHC-HWC. The key role of CHO is maintenance of register for hearing-impaired, 
compilation and validation of data collected by ASHA, conduct monthly meeting with ASHAs/AF/ 
ANM/MPW, screening of target population for common ENT conditions including deafness, health 
promotion with special focus on ENT care, refer cases of hearing impairment to the specialist ENT 
surgeon in consultation with PHC-MO, providing counselling and support for hearing aid users, 
dispensing the medications prescribed by PHC-MO or specialist, referral of cases as appropriate 
and providing follow up care in coordination with you (ASHAs) and MPWs/ANM. 
3. PHC-MO: CHO at SHC-HWC will refer the individuals with any signs and symptoms of loss of 
hearing and other complicated cases of ENT to Medical Officer at PHC for diagnosis. PHC-MO 
will confirm the diagnosis and provide treatment of common ENT conditions/infections, primary 
care for trauma, referral of cases with hearing impairment ENT surgeon for further assessment 
and confirmation, disability certification, outreach activities (planning, monitor wellness clinics/ 
community workers and co-ordination with district hospitals).SERVICE DELIVERY

SKILLS REQUIRED IN PROVIDING BASIC ENT CARE
How to use nasal drops:
 Ask the patient to blow nose gently.
 Wash the hands thoroughly with soap and water.
 Check if the dropper tip is not chipped or cracked.
 Avoid touching the dropper tip against the nasal mucosa.
 Tilt patient’s head as far back as possible or make the patient lie down on the back on a flat 
surface (such as a bed) and hang the head over the edge.
 Put the correct number of drops into the nose.
 Bend head backwards by putting a pillow under the shoulders.
 Remain in this position for a few minutes.
 Clean the dropper tip with warm water. Cap the bottle right away.
 Wash your hands to remove any medication.
How to use ear drops:
 Make the patient lie down or tilt the head with the affected ear facing upwards.
 Open the ear canal by gently pulling the ear upwards and backwards. This straightens the ear 
canal.
 Clear any visible superficial discharge.
 Hold the dropper of the medicine upside down over the ear and put the recommended number 
of drops into the ear.
 Avoid touching the dropper tip inside the ear, as it may get contaminated.
 After use, wipe the tip with a clean tissue. Do not wash with water or soap.
  Advise the patient to stay in the position for at least 15 minutes. A small piece of cotton may 
be used to plug the ear.
Dry Mopping of ear:
-  Only clean their ears with a dry mop when the ear is discharging.
-  When the ear is dry it must not be cleaned with a dry mop.
-  A dry mop is not the same as a ‘cotton bud’.
-  ‘Cotton buds’ must never be used to clean ear canals as they are too big and the cotton wool is 
wound onto the stick too tightly."
ENT Care Training Manual for ASHA,29,"TRAINING MANUAL ON EAR, NOSE AND THROAT (ENT) 6 CARE FOR ASHA AT AYUSHMAN BHARAT – HEAL TH AND WELLNESS CENTRES29How to make a dry mop:
 Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them.
 Pull off a small piece of cotton wool.
 Gently pull it out into an oval shape.
 Put the tip of the stick into the centre of the cotton wool.
 Twist the stick round and round with one hand whilst holding half of the cotton wool tightly 
against the stick with the thumb and index finger of your other hand.
 Half of the cotton wool should extend from the end of the stick and form a fluffy, soft tip.
 The rolled-up piece of cotton wool should be long enough so that when the soft tip is deep in the 
ear canal and next to the eardrum there is still some cotton wool sticking out of the ear canal.
 This is so that you can hold onto the cotton wool and ensure that the cotton wool comes out of 
the ear canal.
 After completing dry mopping, wash your hands again
How to make a wick:
 Make a wick by rolling the cloth or the tissue paper into a pointed shape.
 Gently pull the ear away upwards and outwards. This helps straighten the ear canal.

HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE WITH
REDUCED HEARING/HEARING LOSS
Some ways people can help the children or adults who can’t hear well are:
1. Let the person see your face when you speak to them.
2. Make sure there is good light for the person to see your face.
3. Get the person’s attention before you speak to them.
4. Try to make sure there are no distractions – especially loud noises.
5. Speak clearly and slowly.
6. Don’t shout and make exaggerated movements.
7. Repeat (say again and again) things many times slowly.
8. Use gestures, drawings, pictures – point at things.
9. Do not over protect the person – they should be encouraged to mix with other people.
10. Point to your lips so that they learn to watch how the words are formed – this encourages 
lipreading.
11. Stand close to the person when you speak.
12. If the person has a hearing aid he/she should learn how to use it.

INTRODUCTION  | 1INTRODUCTION
Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) is an approach that can help bring the community  together 
to identify, understand and address common health problems of the community. The process 
comprises of a series of meetings, in which community groups are encouraged to discuss, learn and engage in participatory decision-making that will enable them to take action to address local problems.  
Purpose of the module
This module will help you to learn the process of conducting PLA meetings systematically in your village to improve health of the community. The focus of this module is to address the health issues, based on 
your learning from the previous training - Induction training and training on Modules 6 and 7, Reaching 
the Unreached and Handbook for ASHAs on Mobilizing Action on Violence Against Women.  As part of the PLA cycle, you will conduct meetings with community groups in your coverage area comprising of 
all women and men, adolescent girls and boys, pregnant and lactating women, other community health 
workers, panchayat and VHSNC representatives. The module has been developed to help you engage 
with the communities in a way that is respectful and sensitive to existing inequities in the society.
The module will help you to: 
Prepare for the meetings. z
Conduct PLA meetings using the methodologies explained in each section. z
Make the meeting process as participatory as possible. z
Reflect on the key discussions in the meeting and prepare for subsequent meetings.  z
You will be trained on using the module in three rounds of five days each. During the training 
all methods for conducting PLA meetings will be explained in detail.  The first two rounds would 
cover details of 18 PLA meetings i.e, 9 meetings per round and the third round would cover 
methodologies for 12 remaining  meetings.
Using the ParticiP atory Learning and action (PLa) aPProach, yoU wiLL  be  
abLe to 
Guide the community members to discuss relevant and context – specific issues.  z
Help them understand the underlying causes for the problems that they will identify  during  z
the course of the cycle.
Help to plan and implement strategies using locally available resources. z
Help the communities to evaluate their own actions.  z

AND ACTION (PLA) 2
Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) is a participatory method, in which group members are 
able to improve their problem-solving skills for better health outcomes. Evidence suggests that 
such community mobilization process acts as a sustained capacity building tool for communities and can lead to improvements in health outcomes. The PLA method facilitates utilization of existing health services by the community. It also directly addresses issue of women empowerment, which is 
an important underlying determinant for health and nutrition outcomes.

Identify and prioritise problems
Phase 2
Plan strategies
2.1 Phases of Participatory Learning and Action (PLA)
The PLA meeting cycle has four phases as shown in the figure. Each of these phases comprises of 
several meetings.  
In the first phase, participants of the meeting (community members) prioritize their problems using 
picture cards. In  the second phase they discuss about possible solutions and come up with strategies to address the problems. At the end of the second phase, group members call a larger meeting 
with the community (village level meeting) to share the identified problems and strategies. 
After completion of the first two phases, the prioritized and feasible strategies are implemented in 
the third phase. In the fourth phase the participants evaluate what they have done well and try to assess what they could have done better. "

2.3 Organizing the PLA meeting
Every ASHA will organize one PLA meeting in her coverage area every month. The meetings should 
be organized in a manner that all community members find it convenient to attend the meeting.  
The meetings should be organized using the following principles:"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,10,"10 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAPrinciPLes oF PLa  Meetings
Venue of the meeting should be identified such that–  z
It is convenient for maximum people to attend the meeting specifically members  from •	
marginalized communities (e.g. distant hamlets). 
Venue of  the meetings can be changed to cover the entire population as per group’s •	
consensus.
Location should preferably be in an open space where people can join in freely (e.g. under •	
a tree or a ground).    
Participation of community members to be non-incentivised. z
Duration of meetings to last between one to two hours. z
PLA meetings should be open to all members of the community z
Method of discussion should be facilitation, not didactic or teaching. z
Supportive Mechanisms
ASHA facilitators will use monthly cluster meetings with ASHAs as a forum to introduce the PLA 1. 
methods. The cluster meetings will also be used to practice and plan for PLA meetings as well 
as to discuss issues in conducting PLA meetings. This meeting will provide an opportunity to incorporate feedback to improve the meeting  process further by bridging gaps and taking 
corrective action.
During the induction phase of PLA (first month), ASHA facilitator will conduct 20  meetings i.e, 2. 
one meeting per ASHA in the first month.In subsequent months (second month onwards), all ASHA facilitators will conduct 10 PLA 3. 
meetings with 10 different ASHAs in her supervision area. The remaining 10 ASHAs from the 
neighbouring villages/ areas would participate in these meetings led by ASHA facilitator as an observer/ learner Based on their observations, the 10 learner/ observer ASHAs will conduct 
meeting on the same topic in their coverage areas/ villages in the same month independently.  
The topic of PLA meeting will be same for all ASHAs under one ASHA facilitator in a month.
In the next month, ASHA facilitator would conduct meetings on the third topic in those 10 4. 
villages/ areas where ASHAs conducted meetings independently after observation in the 
second month. The remaining 10 ASHAs (in whose coverage area ASHA facilitator conducted 
the second meeting herself) will observe this third meeting in the neighbouring coverage area or village and conduct the same meeting in their own area in the same month independently. 
Over a period of two months, one facilitator will conduct 20 meetings, one meeting each with 
every ASHA in her supervision area.
ROLLING OUT OF PLA [‘ODD and EVEN’ arrangement]
This arrangement will help the ASHA facilitators to conduct PLA meetings with 10 ASHAs in her supervision area, while the remaining10 ASHAs will learn by observation. The steps involved in this 
arrangement are: 
for the first PLA meeting, the ASHA facilitator will conduct 20 meetings in her supervision  
area i.e, one meeting per ASHA. 
All the ASHAs  under the ASHA facilitators will be numbered.  "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,11,"PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND ACTION (PLA)  | 11from the second PLA meeting, the ASHA facilitator will conduct 10 meetings in 10 ‘ODD’  
numbered ASHAs  (1, 3, 5, etc), while the ASHA will assist her and learn. 
The ‘EVEN’ numbered ASHAs will also attend the above meeting and learn on-the-job.    
The EVEN numbered ASHAs of the neighbouring villages/ areas after observing the meeting  
will conduct similar meeting in their villages/ coverage areas in the same month.
In the third month (meeting number 3), all ASHA facilitators will conduct 10 PLA meetings  
with the ‘EVEN’ numbered ASHAs (2, 4, 6, etc), while the ‘ODD’ numbered ASHAs will now 
observe and conduct meetings in their villages/ areas. 
Using this method over a period of two months, an ASHA facilitator would be able to conduct  
20 meetings, one meeting each with all ASHAs in her supervision area.This process will be repeated every month so that all ASHAs are supported directly by the  
ASHA facilitator. 
The support structures for Community Processes, at all levels will play an important role in 
mentoring the ASHA facilitators and ASHAs for implementation of PLA meetings.  The programme 
will be monitored during the regular field visits and review meetings at all levels. It is important 
for ASHA facilitators  to conduct regular review meetings with ASHAs, as an opportunity to incorporate feedback to improve further, bridge gaps and  take corrective action.
2.4  Who should be attending the Participatory Learning and Action 
meetings?
All community members should be invited to attend the PLA meeting, however, women of 
reproductive age particularly pregnant women and lactating women, newly married women and 
adolescent girls should be prioritized. Special efforts should also be made to ensure participation 
of individuals from marginalized households such as the poorest households or people living in the remote hamlets etc. ASHAASHAASHAASHA

decision-making (for example, older women and men), other frontline health workers, local leaders 
and other stakeholders like VHSNC members, who have important roles to play in community decision 
making.
The number of members attending a meeting can vary. Since the group membership for PLA 
meetings on health issues is open to all, the total number of attendees will increase over the period 
of time. To ensure maximum participation, the optimum number of participants per meeting can range from 25-30. for meetings where the participants are less than 10, you along with other 
members can proactively go around the village to mobilize more people. If attendance is still very low, the meeting can be postponed to a more suitable time and date. 
2.5 General instructions before starting the cycle of PLA meetings
At the start of the first meeting, you will introduce yourself, and encourage all participants to introduce themselves, while ensuring that no one gets left out and discuss your new role as a PLA 
facilitator. 
Ask the group to talk about how they see their role as a member of the PLA group. Some examples include:
Attending meetings voluntarily 
Helping each other and the wider community 
Sharing their knowledge and experiences with others 
Listening to and respecting the opinions of others 
Making their own decisions 
Working together to solve problems 

To introduce the PLA initiative, introduction of all the participants and self.1. 
To explain how we will work in the community. 2. 
To explain how this initiative will be approached.3. 
To discuss the benefits of working together as a group.4. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: Bundle of sticks, pen and notebook.
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 HoursMETHOD: ‘Piggy Back’ and ‘Stick’ Game
METHOD FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1:  Introduction  
Introduce yourself and also introduce any visitor from outside the village. z
Encourage all participants to introduce themselves, making sure that no one gets left out. z
ACTIVITY 2:  The ‘piggy back’ game: Explain that you will start the meeting with a simple game.
Ask 6 participants to volunteer for the game. 1. 
Divide them into 3 pairs. 2. 
Number the pairs 1, 2 and 3. Indicate a starting point and finish line and explain that all pairs 3. 
have to get from the start to the finish line. for each pair, ask one person to represent the 
community and the other to represent the Government schemes and programs.
Pair 1 will go first. Ask the person representing the Government schemes and programs to 4. 
kneel down on all fours and ask the person representing the community to straddle/ sit with 
one leg on either side (like riding) on her back.
Pair 2 will go next. Ask the person representing the Government schemes to stand in front of 5. 
the person representing the community, both looking in the same direction. Ask the one at the 
back (representing the community) to put her arms around her partner’s shoulders (representing government scheme). Participants carry the partner  on her back (piggy-back)."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,14,"14 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAPair 3 will go last. Ask this pair to walk to the finish line holding hands.6. 
  Pair 1        Pair 2    Pair 3
First discuss with the pairs about how they felt about the game …
How easy or difficult was it to move from the starting point to the finishing line? Which pair was most comfortable?
Now explain about how you plan to work in the community. 
Pair 1:   There are certain Government schemes and programmes that are meant for the people. 
But, if people become totally dependent on such  schemes/ programmes  and do not 
take responsibility , their situation may stay the same. (e.g. Attendance in Immunization 
camps or Village Health and Nutrition Day, etc.)
Pair 2:   There are certain other programmes that make communities partially dependent on the Government, and once they are withdrawn, people tend to revert to their old situation. (e.g. withdrawal of certain services by the state, e.g. ambulance services, services related 
to JSSK, etc.)
Pair 3:  Some programmes aim to help communities to help themselves where there is involvement 
of the community in the decisionmaking process and learning from them. (e.g. building 
of toilets where families need to contribute and Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition 
Committees (VHSNC).
Explain that from now onwards we will work like the third pair (walking hand-in hand). Discuss 
with other participants why it is important for them to understand that the Government and the 
community need to go together for maximum benefits.
the PLa  initiative
The PLA approach allows community to learn to identify and talk about the problems they   z
face and to be able to develop and implement strategies to address the problems they 
have identified. 
You will work alongside with community to help them explore for solutions within their own  z
local area and making the most of the available resources. The approach will use community-
level problem solving that will try to improve the status of the community especially women and children. This process also empowers women through working together as it allows all women 
to contribute in the community level activities who may otherwise have not participated. 
It is a slow but empowering process.  z"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,15,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 15Explain that over the next few months the community will learn to participate in decision-making 
to identify and implement strategies  to resolve the common health problems of the community, 
through a series of monthly meetings under the PLA initiative.
The PLA cycle constitutes four phases: Phase 1:   Identify, discuss and prioritise problems: In this phase problems related to community 
health issues will be introduced by showing pictures to the participants that will make it 
easy for them to identify problems. Group members will then prioritise the problems that are most prevalent in their area. 
Phase 2:   Plan strategies: Group members will discuss solutions and feasible strategies to address 
prioritised problems. This phase will end with a community meeting to share identified 
problems and strategies with the larger community and other stakeholders (like VHSNC 
members and Panchayat representatives) to seek their support for implementation of the 
strategies.
Phase 3:   Implement strategies: Group members will implement their strategies and periodically 
review progress.
Phase 4:  Evaluate progress: Members will evaluate the success of the implementation of their strategies.
ACTIVITY 3: T he benefits of working together as a group
Explain that you will now discuss why working through community groups will be useful in this 
approach. Start with another game- ‘Stick game‘. 
Ask one group member (preferably woman) to come forward 
Give her/him one stick and ask her/him to break it – s/he will be able to break it easily. 
Now give her/him a bundle of sticks and ask her/him to hold them together and break    
them – this time s/he will not be able to break! 
The individual stick could be broken but the bundle of sticks could not be broken. Ask the group members to discuss about the game – was the individual stick or the bundle of sticks stronger? and why?
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,16,"16 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAAsk the group to discuss the benefits of working together as a group. Some examples include:
Participants make friends and support one another in a group, they do not feel isolated.  
There is an informal support network which can help them to make difficult decisions.
They discuss and learn from each other about their experiences and rights. 
Group can generate more ideas than any individual working alone. 
Group can help to alleviate the effects of discrimination against women and allows them  to  
integrate in the community and be involved in decision-making. Women develop personal 
strengths and learn to value their role in the community, such as overcoming their fear of self-
expression that improves their self-esteem.
Working together as a group can reach a larger number of people and have a long lasting  
impact.Participants can learn to generate and manage resources.  

UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL INEQUITIES IN SOCIETY
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING
T o encourage participants to recall discussion points from the previous meeting. 1. 
To understand the need to include all sections of the society for all health related issues.2. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: List of questions, chits representing characters for the game, pen and 
notebook.
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 Hours
METHOD: ‘Power Walk’ Game
WHO ARE THE MARGINALIZED PEOPLE?
People who are visible and can be easily reached are the ones who live in the most accessible 
parts in the village. They are also more likely to be educated and better off. In most villages, there 
are others who may belong to one of the following categories and who are marginalized:
families belonging to a particular caste, ethnic, or religious group who are a minority and  
who are not seen as equals by others, such as, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and 
minority communities.
Women headed households, where the husband maybe working outside, where the  
women are separated or deserted by husbands, or husband has died, where women have 
alcoholic husbands or are disabled.
families of those who work as daily wage labourers or are unemployed or destitute. 
families living in distant hamlets/tolas, where houses lie between villages on hilltops or in  
the fields, or areas cut off by rains.
families with disabled children or where there is no adult support. 
Migrant families, either those who migrate into the village, or those who migrate outside  
the village for livelihood and visit periodically.
The families categorized above may also have little information and knowledge on health rights, 
entitlements and the benefits of preventive health services. However, it is they who are most in need of information and services. Unfortunately these families stay uncounted because they are invisible 
and unreached. 
Nothing is more urgent than reaching out to such families. 
As a member of the community and an ASHA, you should know who are most vulnerable and 
likely to be unreached. You can build a trust with them so that their constraints are overcome 
and they are able to access their entitlements and services that are due to them. You can map 
the households and families that are socially excluded and do not access health services readily.  As an ASHA, you should proactively find out the reasons for not availing the services and inform 
them about their health entitlements and why they are needed.  Those families should be 
invited to participate in the PLA meetings, especially pregnant women and mothers with small children."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,18,"18 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAMETHODS FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1: Recap and review of previous meeting 
Ask all participants who were present in the previous meeting to raise their hands and    
make a note of it.
Then ask them to share their learning with those who were not present in the previous  
meeting.Help them to recall the games and important discussions from the previous meeting. 
You will now encourage the participants to actively take part in this meeting.  
ACTIVITY 2: ‘POWER WALK’ GAME— Developing an understanding of issues of inequity in the 
community- Poor and disadvantaged people in villages have high mortality and morbidity rates and 
also poor access to health services. Participants need to understand why some of them experience 
multiple barriers to access health care.
The ‘power walk’ game will help them understand issues of inequity at the village level, motivate 
them to include vulnerable people in meetings and also sensitize them towards the needs of the 
most marginalised. The game will also help participants to: 
Identify and understand why some people get left out in a programme even with the best of  
intentions. 
Plan with community members and other health care providers to identify them, and come  
up with possible strategies to include them.
Method for conducting the ‘Power walk’ game
Choose any eight volunteers from the group. 
Explain the game to the volunteers before the meeting starts. 
Each volunteer will be given a chit with a character that s/he will be representing. 
The volunteers will be asked to keep their role/character a secret. 
To start the game, you will ask them to stand in the center of the group in a line. 
You will ask a few questions related to availing of government services, those characters who  
have received the services as asked in the questions will take one step forward and those 
who did not will stay where they are. 
After each question/service mentioned, at least one participant will stay back and the rest will  
take one step forward.Only the characters who take one step forward are asked the later questions. Changing behaviours is not  easy, especially among the poor and marginalized, who may not 
perceive the immediate gains or when they have other priorities. Hence, you may need to 
undertake repeated visits initially. In spite of all efforts sometime there are families who may not 
access services, and under such circumstances, help may be needed from ANM or the VHSNC 
members."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,19,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 19(For better participation of the characters and for making the game more interactive it is 
suggested that the participants rehearse prior to the meeting. While planning for the game 
each character should also  be given directions on when to stop while playing the game. You 
will also have to be  careful that the characters chosen are fictional, and that no sentiments 
are hurt. Even though the characters should be based on the local situations,  they should 
not represent any individual based on their social reality. While enacting the game, care  
should be taken that people should not be chosen to play a character based on their social 
background). 
Characters for the play: 
Below are examples 
of 8 characters. Other 
characters relevant for the specific area can 
also be included:
Character 1: Pregnant 
woman residing in a 
‘hard to reach’ area. 
Character 2: Pregnant 
woman residing near Anganwadi centre / in 
regular contact with the 
AWW.
Character 3: Daughter-
in-law of the village leader
Character 4: Mother 
with children less than five years of age who is 
unaware of immunization 
schedule.
Character 5: Mother 
who is a daily wage/
migrant labourer.
Character 6: Mother 
who has more than 6 
children.
Character 7: Mother who 
has had no schooling.
Character 8: Mother 
belonging to a 
marginalized (anyone category can be taken from the list mentioned above as per local context) community.
[NOTE: One or more characters for the game can be added or replaced based on the context, and 
number of characters can be decided based on the time available]

UNDERSTANDING CAUSES AND DISCUSSING SOLUTIONS FOR 
PRIORITIzED PROBLEMS
Preparations required prior to Meeting 5. z
Preparing the script for the story using the prioritized problems. z
Preparing hand drawn pictures to be used for the story in the meeting. z
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING
To encourage participants to recall discussion points from the previous meeting.1. 
To understand the causes and effects of the first three prioritized problems/issues in the 2. 
community through a story-telling process.
To arrive at the root causes using the “but why?” game. 3. 
To arrive at the solutions to deal with the problems using the “but what?” game.4. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: Script for story, story based picture cards, pen, notebook, chart paper
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 hoursMETHOD: Story telling using picture cards
METHODS FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1: Recap and review of previous meeting: 
 Ask all participants who were present in the previous meeting to raise their hands and make a  z
note of it.
Then ask them to share their learning with those who were not present in the previous  z
meeting.Help them to recall the games and important discussions from the previous meeting. z
You will now encourage the participants to actively take part in this meeting.  z
ACTIVITY 2: You will use storytelling and picture cards to help women understand the causes 
and effects of the problems they have prioritized. The causes will include both the immediate and underlying causes along with those that are both social and medical.
EXAMPLE: Causes and Effects of Prioritised Problems: Story on Anaemia during pregnancy, Preterm baby and Pre-lacteal feeding    [Note:  the characters in the story should be based on the local situation  but they should be 
fictional and not directly linked to any person dead or living in the village]
Tara got married at the age of 17 and became pregnant within 6 month period. Her diet in pregnancy 
was inadequate and she became anemic and weak. Her family members did not allow her to eat too 
much because they believed that it would prevent proper growth of the baby in the womb and that 
she would have indigestion. She refused to eat meat, fish, eggs and green leafy vegetables during "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,27,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 27most of her pregnancy because of the distaste. In the 8th month of pregnancy she gave birth to a 
premature baby. The baby cried all the time which made her think that she had insufficient breast 
milk for the baby. The family also told Tara that thick yellow first milk (colostrum) was bad for the 
baby, so they tried to give the baby goat’s milk, which the baby refused. Tara had thrown away the colostrum. The third day, she found that the baby was very inactive  and was unable to take feed at 
all and the next day the baby died.
[Picture cards for use in the story will be for the highlighted parts of the story – based on underlying 
causes and immediate cause – medical, social, cultural, etc] 
After narrating the story you will ask any group member to repeat the story using the picture cards 
to remind them of the main causes leading to death of the child.
ACTIVITY 3: Process of 
discussing the root causes 
and solutions to the prioritized 
problems After the story has 
been repeated by a group 
member, you will explain that they will be  playing a game 
called ‘but why?’
 Encourage all participants  z
to take part in this exercise.
 Allow the picture cards to  z
remain on the ground after 
the story-telling session.
 Keep asking the group  z
to look at the pictures on 
the ground and discuss 
amongst themselves why the child died until the participants are able to uncover all the causes 
to the problem that has been included /embedded in the story. 
The ‘but why…?’ game
Q: Why did Tara’s baby die?
A:  Because the baby did not 
get breast milk in the first 
three days of life. 
Q: But why did the baby not 
get breast milk in the first 
three days?
A: Because Tara had thrown 
the colostrum. 
Q: What was given to the baby 
for three days?
A: Tara had tried to give goat’s 
milk that the baby refused.
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,28,"28 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAQ: Why was he being given goat’s milk? 
A: Because she thought her milk was insufficient and the family asked her to feed him goat’s milk.Q: Why was the baby refusing to feed well?
A: Because baby was born premature. 
Q: But why was the baby born premature?A: Because Tara was very weak in pregnancy. Q: But why was she weak? 
A: Because she did not eat enough in pregnancy.
Q: And what were the other reasons of her being weak?
A: Because she had an early marriage and early child birth.
Now read out all the causes you had listed at the end of the ‘but why?’ game that led to the baby’s 
death.
ACTIVITY 4: Discussing about possible solutions to deal with the problems using “but what?” 
Now tell the participants that using these causes they will discuss about possible solutions, by 
asking ‘What could Tara have done in pregnancy to have a healthy baby? What could the family 
have done to improve the chances of survival after the birth?’
Then list all the solutions in your register. Example of identified ‘causes’ and ‘solutions’ in the box below:
Possible causes for the baby’s death Possible solutions for preventing baby’s death
Mother married early, gave birth early, did not eat 
enough.If Tara had married late and delayed the first pregnancy and  had eaten more frequent meals and more vitamin/iron rich 
foods, received family support throughout her pregnancy
Baby born premature, too small to suckle and 
colostrum was discarded, baby refused to takegoat’s milk.If the baby was taken to hospital after premature birth, made sure he was immediately put to breast and was given colostrum, given warmth, breastfed exclusively,  given ex -
pressed milk using a spoon if the baby was unable to suckle properly.

ExPLORING AND CHOOSING APPROPRIATE STRATEGIES
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING 
T o encourage participants to recall discussion points from the previous meeting.1. 
To identify strategies arising out of the solutions using the ‘bridge’ game.2. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: Chart with list of solutions (from meeting 5), 2 bricks, 2 sticks, few wooden 
planks, pen and register
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 HoursMETHOD: Bridge Game
METHODS FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1: Recap and review of previous meeting: 
 Ask all participants who were present in the previous meeting to raise their hands and make a  z
note of it.
Then ask them to share their learning with those who were not present in the previous meeting z
Help them to recall the games and important discussions from the previous meeting. z
You will now encourage the participants to actively take part in this meeting.  z
ACTIVITY 2: Understanding the opportunities and barriers before identifying strategies You will 
explain that they will be playing ‘the bridge’ game which is a practical and visual exercise to help 
participants understand how they can go from their present situation of “where they are now” (poor health) to “where they would like to be” in future, that is towards being healthier:
 Ask the participants to imagine that they are standing on one bank of a river. A brick is placed on the  z
ground to represent the current situation regarding health of women and children in the community. 
for better understanding and visibility place the prioritized problem cards next to the brick.
Another brick is placed a little away to represent the other bank of the river and also the situation  z
where the community would like to be in future. 
 The river is the barrier that is preventing them from reaching where they want to be.  z
 To overcome the barriers they will have to build a bridge that will represent the strategies that  z
they will decide now. 
 You will place 2 long sticks across the bricks to represent the strengths of the groups which will  z
provide the supportive base for implementing the strategies.
 Shorter planks will then be placed across the two longer sticks. Each of these planks will represent  z
a strategy that the group has already decided.
Once the final bridge has been shown and what each item represents has been described, you will 
remind them about the discussions from previous meetings:
The first brick = where we are now? (E.g. maternal and newborn problems).1. "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,30,"30 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAThe second brick = where do we want to be? (E.g. healthy mother and healthy baby).2. 
The river = the barriers we face (e.g. cultural restrictions for colostrum feeding, dietary restrictions 3. 
in pregnancy, pre-lacteal feeding, early marriages, etc.).
The two long sticks = the strengths we have as a group (e.g. strong group, helpful village 4. 
leader,unity among group members, regular group meetings, etc.).
The shorter planks = the strategies the group will come up with. They will now decide what 5. 
these would be…
2nd brick- Where do we want to go? Planks - Strategies
Long sticks - Strengths 
River/Barrier 1st brick – Where we are now?
To identify strategies you will ask ‘but how?’ - Referring to the list of solutions from the previous 
meeting, encourage the participants to discuss about doable strategies that can be implemented 
by them as a group:"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,31,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 31for example, “But how can you improve the chances of survival after the baby is born?”  
 When members have provided an answer, ask ‘But how can that strategy be   
employed?’ This enables them to discuss about the opportunities and means of overcoming 
the barriers.  
Keep prompting for as many suggestions as possible.  
Continue asking “But how?” to all the responses until it is not possible to answer the question  
anymore or until they agree that they have identified all the relevant strategies. 
 Repeat the process for all the solutions from the previous meeting.  
 Explain that they should discuss and identify what might help those strategies (opportunities)  
to work and what might obstruct those strategies (barriers).
Ask them to think about the opportunities that might help them in implementing the strategies,  
example: VHND,  VHSNC,  AWC services, etc, while the space below the bridge represents 
the barriers, Example -  harmful rituals/practices, superstitions, etc.
Only when the group has  decided they want to implement a strategy and that it is feasible  
for them, you will place a short plank on the bridge. Similarly, all the strategies are taken up and the bridge is completed. 
 You will note down the outcomes on a separate chart (use the chart below called ‘strategy  
format’ for noting down).
Example of identified ‘causes’ and ‘solutions’ in the box below:

You will use the following story and picture cards to help members understand the underlying 
causes of under nutrition among women.
Example of a story: Shila’s family was large and being the oldest, she had to look after her siblings. After feeding all of 
them she would take whatever was left over.   At the age of 13 when her menstrual period started, 
she had excessive bleeding and she looked very pale.  Her mother thought that her skin looked 
fair, not pale. At 16 years she was married and soon after she became pregnant.  During pregnancy 
her mother-in-law prevented her from taking rest and taking more food.  She did not have any ANC 
and did not take If A tablets.  One day the ASHA noticed that  Shila looked sick and asked her to get 
her blood tested, but Shila’s mother-in-law did not allow it.  The ASHA advised her to take green 
vegetables, fruits and If A, but she did not take them.  Shila delivered a stillborn baby in the 8th month.  
When she had high bleeding after childbirth, the doctor advised her to go to a higher centre where "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,39,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 39she could be given blood, but the ambulance was not available.  Because they did not have enough 
money, the  family decided to bring her back home. Her mother-in-law gave her just one meal in 
the day  consisting of rice with garlic and salt and made her do all the house work.
Shila became breathless after doing routine work and when she went to the well to collect water 
she fainted. Her family members called the faith healer to perform rituals and also got her treated 
by the informal provider,  but Shila did not regain consciousness and when her husband tried to 
take her to hospital, she died on the way. 
 Ask one of the members to repeat the story using the picture cards that will remain on the  z
ground.
 Tell the members that they will play ‘the chain game’ to help them identify solutions for preventing  z
maternal under strategies nutrition. This practical and visual exercise will help participants to 
understand and analyze the causes and help them to identify strategies to prevent under nutrition. 
Ask the members “why did the mother die?” to arrive at all the underlying causes. (Use the ‘but  z
why?’ game as in meeting 5).Allow the members to think of possible causes that may have led to the mother’s death.  z
Keep a note of all the responses and group the different causes under 4 categories: z
Nutrition (green color)   – having to do with feeding practices.
Cultural Practices (yellow color)   – having to do with people’s attitudes, customs, beliefs, etc.
Illness (red color)   - caused by infections (virus, parasite, bacteria) or deficiencies, etc.
Entitlements (blue color)   - related with government services and benefits.
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,40,"40 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHA You can use paper bands or ribbons of four different colors to represent the four major categories  z
and explain what each of the colors represents.
 While reminding the group about the causes mentioned by them earlier, ask them to classify the  z
causes under the 4 categories.
 You will use a cut out/ dummy of a woman for this game. z
 Randomly distribute the colored ribbons/ bands among the participants. Each time you call out  z
a cause, the members will reflect under which category it would fall and the one with the correct 
colored ribbon will tie the ribbon to the  dummy’s/ cut out’s leg. for each subsequent cause a 
new ribbon is tied  to the existing one in the form of a chain to the dummy’s/ cut out’s leg.
The chain/shackle gradually increases to show how the woman  can be burdened with    z
all the causes leading to the problem of undernutrition and eventual death. 
ACTIVITY 4: Identifying possible strategies for improving nutritional status of women:
for removing the chain or to unshackle you will now ask, “what can be done to prevent the death? 
Encourage the members to think of different strategies to deal with the problem. The group 
members think of various possibilities and discuss them openly. As they decide the strategies they 
remove the ribbon (chain) one by one. Keep a note of all the strategies and support them to pursue 
it together.

good look at each card and place them on the ground.
for each card ask them to discuss if it is an emergency or non-emergency problem.  z
Those cards that are emergencies stay face up and those which are not are put face   z
down.
ACTIVITY 4:   Accessing appropriate care – ‘ Voting with feet’
You will explain that they will be playing a game using problem picture cards to understand which 
facility to visit during emergency and non-emergency problems through the following steps:
a) Ask the members to make circles on the ground large enough for a group of women to  
stand in. "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,42,"42 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAb) Then put pictures of a District hospital, Primary health centre, Sub-centre, ANM, Anganwadi 
centre, f aith healer, Village doctor, Dai, next to the circles.
c) You will hold a problem card, and the participants will have 15 seconds to decide the appropriate circle (facility) to go to for treatment of that ‘problem’. 
d) You will then initiate a discussion with members standing on each circle in turn, and ask why 
they think the circle is the appropriate place to go to and give them another chance if they want 
to change. 
e) You will then tell them which circle is the appropriate place to go to for that particular problem.
f) The above process will be repeated till all the problem cards have been discussed.

PURPOSE OF THE MEETING 
To help participants review the main discussion of the previous meeting.1. 
To review the implementation and progress of strategies that the group had identified. 2. 
To discuss about birth preparedness for pregnant women.3. 
To prepare the group to respond to emergencies during pregnancy, delivery and post-partum 4. 
through an “emergency drill”.
MATERIALS REQUIRED: MCP Card, mosquito net ,vegetable basket, delivery kit, TT injection, 
nischay Kit ,If A tab, strip of  deworming tablets, strategies implementation format 
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 Hours
METHOD: “Sequencing game” 
METHOD FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1 ANd 2: Recap and review of previous meeting and the implementation of strategies: 
You will do the following: 
Help the participants to recall the discussion from the previous meeting. (as given on   z
page 17)
Discuss the progress of implementation of health related strategies decided by the group. (as  z
given on page 37) Keep a record of the progress made for the chosen strategies,  z
 Encourage participants to share their experiences and learning during implementation,  z
Discuss about the problems encountered and how they have resolved it  z
Discuss about areas for improvement to make the intervention more effective z
ACTIVITY 3: Understanding the importance and components of birth preparedness plan:
 Ask members about their understanding of birth preparedness and what plans they normally  z
make in advance for a safe delivery and keep a note of all the responses.
Now explain that the factors that prevent women from accessing health care can be categorized  z
as 3 delays’:
-  delay in decision to seek care: delay in recognizing a problem/complication and deciding to 
seek care for a woman in labour  
- delay in reaching a health facility: delays related to transport/money/ bad roads/bad weather 
in reaching the health facility
- delay in receiving adequate care after reaching the facility: not getting timely/ quality/ 
appropriate care at the health facility"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,45,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 45following the discussion, ask the members to share about any such event/death which they think 
could have been prevented if planning was done in advance for delivery. 
 Emphasize that it is important to make plans for birth and emergencies because every pregnancy  z
can be potentially considered risky (can develop complications). Birth preparedness can help 
reduce delays and prevent many maternal and new born deaths. 
 Tell the members that they will play a game that will focus on preparing for birth. z
distribute some materials before starting the discussion:
The materials are:
Mother and child 1. 
protection card - 
registration
Pregnancy testing 2. 
kit: for confirming a 
pregnancy 
IfA tablets 3. 
Syringe4. 
MCP card – 4 check 5.

A Delivery Kit: (when there is a delay in reaching the health care centre)13. 
You will tell the members to imagine a pregnant woman in their community and ask the participants  z
holding the pictures/materials to stand in the order (sequence) that the woman would be using 
as shown in the picture or the related materials during the course of her pregnancy. 
The members holding the particular card/material can take help from those who are not  z
participating in the game. 
After this game you will summarize the discussion and highlight the importance of each component 
that needs to be kept in mind while planning for birth.
ACTIVITY 4: R esponding to an emergency – ‘The Emergency Drill’
You will explain to the group that they are now going to enact what should be done in an emergency 
through a “drill”. [Please refer to the ASHA module 6 in preparation for this meeting.]
Ask the members to think about an emergency problem that a woman suffered from during her  z
pregnancy, delivery or post-partum period that led to a maternal death in their village. 
Encourage them to have a discussion and come to a consensus on the problem to be discussed. z
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,46,"46 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAExplain that based on this problem they will be doing a “drill” to deal with the emergency. z
You will ask some of the members to volunteer for this game, to play the role of the following  z
characters, like, a woman with  the problem, ‘ASHA’, ‘husband’, ‘mother in law’, ‘Dai (TBA)’, ‘f aith 
healer’, ‘Village doctor’, ‘ANM’, ‘Doctor’ etc.
Now ask them to enact what women in their community usually do when a woman has such a  z
problem.
for example: ‘Retained placenta’ as an emergency problem - One member pretends to be suffering 
from retained placenta. Her husband waits for a while but when the placenta still does not come out, 
calls a traditional birth attendant, who examines and tells the husband that she needs to be referred. 
The other participants help the couple to decide the next steps.Now discuss with the group from the start of the story what the women in the community should 
have done. You should keep probing for further course of action until you are satisfied that they 
had a good ‘emergency drill’ for this problem.
This process can be repeated for more than one problem if the members agree and if time allows.WHAT ARE THE COMMON DELAYS IN RESPONDING TO EMERGENCIES AND HOW IT CAN BE 
REDUCED?
Encourage discussion on the following aspects:
What delays were experienced in the role play and how can these be reduced? 
What other delays are common in the community and how can they be reduced (e.g.  
delays in recognizing there is a problem, delays in deciding to seek care, delays in reaching 
appropriate care, delays in receiving appropriate care at the  facility). 
Do they think that if the problems/danger signs are identified on time, the delays could be  
reduced?
“things to reMeMber For birth PreP aredness”
Birth preparedness i.e. (planning in advance for a delivery) can help reduce delays and 
complications. Key elements of birth preparedness include:
 Attending antenatal care at least four times during pregnancy. z
 Care during pregnancy: Eating more than usual, avoiding heavy work and resting more. z
Informing the ASHA as soon as labour starts. z
Identifying a skilled provider and making a plan for reaching the health facility as soon as  z
labour starts.
 Setting aside personal funds to cover the costs of travelling and delivery with a skilled  z
provider, if needed.
Being able to recognize signs of complications during pregnancy and labour / child birth. z
Knowledge of available resources – emergency transport, funds, communication systems. z
Having a plan for emergencies – such as identifying person(s) to accompany to the hospital  z
and/or stay at home with family; and identifying a blood donor."

Story on Postnatal Care
Salima was pregnant for the first time and she delivered a full term baby at home with assistance 
from a Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA). The baby was normal and was given honey and sugar 
water after 4 hours and was started on breastfeeding after one day. Salima was asked to squeeze out the first milk on the first day and throw it. Salima was not confident that the baby was growing well in spite of the baby feeding well. She developed congestion in her breast with 
fever. Her neighbor advised her to give the baby cow’s milk diluted with water. Salima could not 
feed her baby because of pain in her breast and after a week, the baby developed diarrhoea, became lethargic and developed difficulty in breathing. She took her to a traditional healer for 
performing rituals. The baby’s condition worsened and baby died after 2 days."

ACTIVITY 1 ANd 2: Recap and review of previous meeting and the implementation of strategies: 
You will do the following: 
Help the participants to recall the discussion from the previous meeting. (as given on page 16) z

Discuss about areas for improvement to make the intervention more effective. z
ACTIVITY 3: Demonstration of positioning and attachment while breastfeeding:
Explain that many mothers feel that they do not produce enough milk. However it is important to 
ensure that the baby is positioned and attached correctly on the breast and that “the more the 
baby suckles, the more milk is produced.”
Use the dummy to demonstrate the proper method of breastfeeding: 
Correct positioning /placing (correct way to put the baby to breast) – The body and   1. 
head to be in a straight line with baby facing the mother and close to the mother so that the 
whole body is supported.
Correct attachment – chin to touch the breast with mouth fully open, lower lip turned outward 2. 
and areola seen more at the upper side than at the lower side.  Burping/winding - At the end of breast feeding the baby should be burped. Burping to be 3. 
done at the end of each feed by holding the baby in an upright position against  the shoulder 
and gently tapping or massaging the back until a burp is heard. This is to prevent vomiting and 
milk aspiration. "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,55,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 55feeding the baby as much as s/he wants, both day and night (atleast 8 to12 times in a day). If a 
breastfed baby passes urine 6 times or more in a day then it indicates  implying that the baby is 
being fed adequately.
You will allow the members to repeat the above mentioned processes to familiarize them with the 
practices/activities.
ACTIVITY 4: Exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months:
You will encourage the mothers to share their experiences of breastfeeding their babies.  z
Allow them to identify all mothers who had exclusively breastfed their baby for the first six  z
months and those who did not. 
Now ask those who did not do exclusive breastfeeding why it was so and about the difficulties  z
that they faced. To those mothers who had exclusively breastfed, find out their experiences and 
how they overcame the difficulties. 
Now discuss about the importance of exclusive breast feeding for the first six months which  z
means - NO WATER, NO PRE – LACTEALS, NO fOOD. 
 No water – because 88% of breast milk is water. Even in very hot climates, breast milk contains  
enough water to satisfy child’s thirst.
No Pre – Lacteals or (food or milk from other sorces like cow/buffalo etc or powder milk) –  
because child’s digestive system is delicate and is not designed to digest anything other than 
mother’s milk. That pre-lacteal feeds can introduce infection causing harm.
No food – because breast milk has all the nutrients the infant needs. Exclusive breastfeeding also helps in delaying the onset of periods, thereby reducing the risk  z
of pregnancy.PROPER

ASHA of the village meets her on the way…[let us now see the interactions]
ASHA: Karina, Are you ok?Karina: Didi, I wanted to meet you to inform you that I am 4 months pregnant."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,57,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 57ASHA: ‘That’s good news! You have to be careful because this is your first pregnancy and you 
are only 16 years old. Register your pregnancy at the AWC and visit at least 4 times to get your 
entitlements. [After calculating her expected date of delivery (EDD)] say that her delivery will 
be in winter and therefore she will have to be extra careful, provide warmth to the baby, keep sufficient clean and dried clothes for wrapping the baby and for her own use after delivery. Even 
the room has to be kept warm and clean.’
[Narrator: Karina attends the VHND and registers her pregnancy; her weight and blood pressure 
are measured and her abdominal checkup is done. She receives iron tablets and TT injections. 
Karina is advised about diet; about the benefits of institutional delivery and Janani Surakhsha 
Yojana (JSY) scheme. Because she was busy with her routine household chores she forgot to take the If A tablets regulaly and ignored ASHA’s advice. In her 8th month the ASHA visits Karina.]
ASHA: “Karina, are all the preparations for your delivery done?” 
Karina: “Yes didi, as per your advice I have made all the preparations and I will try to go the health 
facility as you had advised.” 
ASHA: “But Karina, your abdomen size is looking small, maybe the child is not growing well and 
your baby is small. A baby born before time and in winter months will need extra care and has to be kept covered and warm.” 
[Narrator: Karina’s labour pain started earlier than expected in the 8th month itself. At the time 
of delivery ASHA had accompanied Karina and her husband to the nearest CHC when the baby 
was weighed at the hospital, the nurse informed Karina and ASHA that weight of the baby is 2100 
grams.
ASHA: “Karina, since your baby is low birth weight it will need more breast milk and skin-to-skin 
care. (You request any mother to demonstrate Kangaroo care using the dummy).  If the baby is 
not able to suckle properly, then give expressed breast milk using a clean bowl and spoon. The 
baby’s feet must be checked repeatedly for cold feet which is a sign of hypothermia. (ASHA will 
demonstrate the method for checking hypothermia).  
[Narrator: Karina’s mother-in-law and husband provide support in giving kangaroo care, cleaning 
up the baby and other household and outside work. She is given nutritious food without any food restrictions. This diet will help to produce more milk that will increase the baby’s weight. Karina 
always washes her hands with soap before feeding the baby.] 
After completing the role play you will appeal to the participants, saying: “Now you all know that it is possible to save the life of small babies, twins and premature babies.”
ACTIVITY 4: Discussion on management of high risk new borns - pre- term and low birth weight 
babies:
Low-birth-weight (LBW) means a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (up to and including 2,499g), 
regardless of gestational age. This includes:
Babies who are born premature (that is, who are born before 37 weeks / 8 months 14 days  z
weeks of gestational age). 
Babies who are small for gestational age or did not grow well inside the womb.   z
Babies who are not able to feed on day 1 of the birth are also at higher risk. "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,58,"58 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAYou will then share some important information to help them take care of twins, premature and low 
birth weight babies:  
Low birth weight babies need to be breast fed more frequently to grow, give expressed breast a) 
milk if unable to suckle.
Low birth weight babies need more time to adjust to life outside the womb and should be kept b) 
warm by skin-to-skin contact (KMC by mother or other family members) and wrapping.
Baby’s feet to be checked for cold feet which is a sign of hypothermia. c) 
Adequate breastfeeding to meet the need even in case of low birth weight and premature babies.d) 
Baby to get the rich hind milk (the milk at the end of the feeding) that is very high in fat and is best 
for the baby’s weight gain, brain development and stool formation.
As the ASHA, you should also measure the temperature of the baby using the digital thermometer 
in your kit and the weighing scale to measure the weight of the baby on every visit. 
After this discussion you will discuss about feeding practices for low birth weight babies:
What? Breast Milk, and if the baby is unable to suckle then expressed breast milk should be given
How? Breastfeeding, if the baby is unable to suckle then the baby should be given breast milk with 
the help of cup and spoon
When? Breastfeeding to be initiated within 30 minutes of birth and baby to be fed at least every  
2 hours How much? Baby to be fed on demand

MATERIALS REQUIRED: Strategies implementation format, picture card specifying danger sign, list 
of questions for game, note book and pen.
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 HoursMETHOD: Game – Interactive discussion using picture cards, “Oral drill”. 
METHOD FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1 ANd 2: Recap and review of previous meeting and the implementation of strategies: 
You will do the following:
Help the participants to recall the discussion from the previous meeting. (as given on page 16) z
Discuss the progress of implementation of health related strategies decided by the group. (as  z
given on page 37) 
Keep a record of the progress made for the chosen strategies,  z
Encourage participants to share their experiences and learning during implementation,  z
Discuss about the problems encountered and how they have resolved it  z
Discuss about areas for improvement to make the intervention more effective. z
ACTIVITY 3: Understanding and identifying types of infections commonly seen among 
newborns 
You will tell the group that infection is a major cause for newborn deaths and that two types of 
infections are commonly seen: Local infections (Local Bacterial Infection (LBI)) – meaning those 
infections which are limited to a particular organ/ system e.g. eye infections, umbilical discharge, less than 10 skin pustules. Sepsis (Possible Severe Bacterial Infection (PSBI))– are those which 
spread to the whole body and cause a generalised systemic illness (sepsis) characterized by signs 
like fever, difficulty in breathing, inability to breast feed, etc.
Use picture cards to help them identify and classify signs/symptoms in newborns with Sepsis   z
and local infections .
Pass all the picture cards around so that all women get a good look at each card. z"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,60,"60 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHAThen place the cards on the floor and ask them to select the card they would first like to  z
discuss.
for each of the card ask them to describe what they see in the picture. Using the text written on  z
the backside of each card help them to identify the danger signs among newborns that need 
immediate medical attention or treatment at health facility.

In case the thermometer is not available you can FEEL ANd MEASURE TEMPERATURE TO  z
dETECT IF THE BABY IS TOO COLd OR HAS FEVER
For fever
Using the dorsum (upper part) of one hand feel the fore head of the newborn and with the dorsum 
of the other hand feel your own forehead. This will help to detect fever in young infants.
For Hypothermia
Using the dorsum of one hand feel the abdomen first and then the feet of the newborn and with 
the dorsum of the other hand feel your own forehead. This will help to detect the hypothermia in young infants. 
Counting breaths in one minute
Wait for the newborn to be calm (or sleeping). Do not count when the baby is •	
breastfeeding.
Make sure that there is enough light to see the breathing movements.•	
Gently lift the baby’s shirt so you can see breathing  movements. The chest and abdomen •	
rising and falling once makes one breath.Watch a few breaths until you are sure when the baby is  breathing in and out.•	
Start the timer – digital watch (mobile can be used for setting the time) and count the •	
breaths for one full minute (until the final beep, which is at the end of one minute).Record the number of breaths.•	
If there are 60 breaths per minute or more, repeat the count and record the number of •	
breaths a second time. f ast breathing is a sign of Possible Severe Bacterial Infection (PSBI)Chest in drawing: 
Lower chest wall going in while breathing in
[Normal breathing rate for babies is as follows:
from birth to 2 months – 60 breaths per minute 
from 2 months to 12 months – 50 breaths per minute 
from 12 months to 5 years – 40 breaths per minute  
Ask some of the members to volunteer to demonstrate the process of identifying hypothermia, 
fever and counting of respiratory rate, etc. remind the group about observing chest in-drawing. 
ACTIVITY 4: Classification of danger signs through “Oral Drill” Game:
Remind them of signs of newborn infections by showing the picture cards again. z
Explain that they will be playing a game for classifying signs of infection. Mark three different  z
shapes on the ground. ‘Round shape’ for Sepsis (PSBI) which would require treatment at health 
facility, ‘Square shape’ for local infection (LBI) which can be managed by ASHA and ANM and 
‘Triangular shape’ for no infection.
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,61,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 61In case of Sepsis, you can initiate the treatment (by giving first dose of Amoxycillin from your  z
drug kit -Refer to Module 7) and refer the child immediately to the health facility for treatment. 
Tell them that you will be calling out a ‘sign’ from the list of questions [mentioned in the box  z
below] and ask them to classify which type of infection it is or if it is not an infection. 
In just 30 seconds they have to run and reach the ‘shape’ which they think is appropriate for that  z
particular sign - If the answer is incorrect probe for the correct response and if the answer is 
correct encourage the members and praise them for the right response.

UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERGENERATIONAL 
CYCLE OF UNDERNUTRITION
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING 
To help participants review the main discussion of the previous meeting.1. 
To understand the diverse causes of under nutrition.2. 
To understand the importance of the first 1000 days of life.3. 
To understand the group’s perception of prevailing behaviour and practices related to       4. 
nutrition and health among mothers and children under-2 years of age.
To understand about growth monitoring, referral and follow up of undernourished children.5. 
MATERIALS REQUIRED: Strategies implementation format, flex of malnutrition cycle, questions on 
current practices, pen and register 
TIME TAKEN: 1-2 HoursMETHOD: Game – flex/Chart with intergenerational cycle and discussion
METHOD FOR CONDUCTING MEETING
ACTIVITY 1 ANd 2: Recap and review of previous meeting and the implementation of strategies: 
You will do the following:
Help the participants to recall the discussion from the previous meeting. (as given on page 16) z
Discuss the progress of implementation of health related strategies decided by the group. (as  z
given on page 37) 
Keep a record of the progress made for the strategies. z
Encourage participants to share their experiences and learning during implementation.  z
Discuss about the problems encountered and how they have resolved it  z
Discuss about areas for improvement to make the intervention more effective. z
ACTIVITY 3: Use of flex/chart with pictures to understand the inter-generational undernutrition 
cycle: 
You will show the flex/ chart with the under nutrition cycle to the participants.  z
Ask them what they understand from the chart. z
Emphasize that undernutrition runs in an inter-generational cycle. Young girls who grow poorly  z
become stunted and are more likely to give birth to low birth weight babies. If those babies are 
girls, they are likely to continue the cycle by being stunted in adulthood.  In case of adolescent 
pregnancy the risk of low birth weight babies increases. 
Now, for each stage of the cycle, ask participants what according to them are the causes for under  z
nutrition. (f or example, in pregnancy, they could discuss about insufficient food, unbalanced 
diet, food restrictions or inadequate care for health problems.)Continue to ask and probe for each phase of the cycle. Ensure that all the causes that you have  z
noted in the notebook are covered in detail."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,64,"64 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHASummarize that undernutrition has multiple causes and therefore has to be addressed at different  z
levels and at all phases of the lifecycle to improve the health of the mothers and children.
Explain that ill health and undernutrition can be prevented if the cycle can be broken. Together  z
they will be discussing methods for breaking the cycle in subsequent meetings.Discuss about the importance of the first 1000 days beginning from pregnancy through the first  z
2 years of life of the child.
ACTIVITY 4: Group’s perception of current practices related to health and nutrition among women 
and children: 
Once again refer to the life cycle chart and focus on undernutrition during pregnancy and moving  z
through birth, infancy, early childhood and adolescence because good nutritional support is 
needed at all stages. 
Sensitize the community about addressing undernutrition and anaemia much before girls reach  z
the reproductive age.  
Ask the group about current practices related to health and nutrition for each stage of the life  z
cycle. [0-6 months, 6 months–5 years, adolescence, pregnancy]
first ask if they agree that the cycle can be ‘broken’. To break the cycle it is important to first  z
identify it.
Allow the group to discuss about the current practices in their village openly.
The following questions will help you to keep the group focused on the issue:
What do they understand by ‘under nutrition’? What do they call it?(local names) z
Are there any food restrictions during pregnancy? If yes, what are they? Why is it so?  z
Are there food restrictions for lactating women? If yes, what are they? Why is it so?  z
Do they think adolescent girls have special dietary needs? If so, why? z
Why do they think under nutrition occurs in children? z
At what age can it start?  zMalnutrition

PLA Module for ASHA_English,65,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 65How soon after childbirth do women generally breastfeed their newborn? z
Do they think pre-lacteals are required for children? z
Is breastfeeding enough for children up to 6 months of age? z
When do children usually start getting semi-solid food in the community? z
What kinds of food do children aged 6-9 months normally eat? z
How often are they fed? z
How do they keep the food and for how long? (prompt for cooked food, drinking water, etc) z

why?
Which diseases do they think can be prevented by the Government’s routine immunization  z
programme?What other diseases do children suffer from? What do people do when these happen? z
ACTIVITY 5: a) Discuss about importance of growth monitoring:
Now discuss about methods for identifying undernutrition and monitoring a child’s growth.  z
Emphasize that we know our children are growing when we see them becoming taller, fatter,  z
heavier to carry, growing out of their clothes. The only way to know if the growth is normal is to 
measure the weight of the child regularly. 
Regular weighing and keeping records on the growth chart(separate for boys and girls) showing  z
weight in relation to age is the best way for children (up to the age of 5 years.)The individual growth curve should follow the trend as per the normal curve given on the  z
chart. Any change in trend (the child’s curve going upward or downward from its normal track, or a flat  z
line) should be investigated to determine its cause and corrective action taken.
You will tell them that growth rates of younger children are faster, therefore sharper in the first  z
year of life. 
Strategies to prevent growth failure:
Early initiation of breastfeeding (within half an hour of childbirth). z
Exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months, while ensuring frequency. z
Timely introduction of complementary foods at 6 months with continuation of breastfeeding  z
up to 2 years or beyond.
feeding different food groups at each serving, thereby ensuring variety in the food.  z
Age appropriate quality, quantity and frequency of feeding practices. z
Addition of oil/ fat (half a teaspoon per day) to vegetables and other foods to provide extra  z
energy. Use of iodized salt. z
feeding sick child frequently during illness and giving extra feeds after recovery. z"

hands with soap. (demonstrate the actual method of hand washing)"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,69,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 69Now ask mothers to start feeding their children with the food they have brought or prepared  
by the AWW for this occasion.
Discuss with mothers about the importance of continuing breastfeeding for those children who  z
started semisolid food.
Initiate a discussion on the importance of timely introduction of complementary food: z
That exclusive breastfeeding until six month is recommended.  
After six months breast milk alone is not adequate, particularly for iron and calories that solid  
foods provide. Complementary food provides a balanced diet for proper growth and development. 
Cereal-based foods are usually the first foods for the infant. Other food, including strained or  
mashed fruits, vegetables, meats, eggs and fish, can be added to the diet later.
ACTIVITY 4: Demonstration of recipes on enriching food:
first wash hands with soap  z (demonstrate the actual method of hand washing)
Ask the participants about the recipes that they normally prepare for children entering six  z
months of age and keep a note of it. Now discuss about some recipes that are usually given to children entering six months and are  z
prepared in the community like, rice pudding, rice porridge, commonly used snacks, finger food 
(foods that children can hold and eat by themselves), etc. and discuss how they can be enriched 
or made more nutritious, emphasizing that a good meal has to have: rice or other cereal/green 
leafy vegetables/pulses and fruit. Whenever possible an animal source food and addition of oil is recommended.
Engage the participants in an enriching food game:
Keep “Mixed  z Sattu” (which is provided by the AWW for babies) in a bowl. Now ask members 
what they would like to add to sattu using food items and chits to enrich the recipe (e.g. adding sugar/jaggery , oil or juice of seasonal fruits, ask them to suggest locally available food).

their mother went out for work,` their grandmother took care of Ali and gave him bottle feeds. One day Shabnam returned from school to find her brother very dull. Her grandmother said that he was having diarrhoea since morning and has passed watery stool more than three times.  She also told Shabnam that she has not given any food or milk to Ali as he will not be able to digest any food in this condition. Shabnam remembered that her school teacher once told them that diarrhoea can be caused because of unhygienic food or water and it could be very serious in a small child. The teacher had also told them that just like a plant which dies in absence of adequate water; if human body loses high quantity of water then the person can become weak and may even die.  Shabnam convinced her grandmother to give Ali something to drink quickly otherwise his condition may worsen. She told her grandmother that she had learned to prepare rehydration solutions at home, and she would later get ORS packet from the ASHA. Grandma was happy that Shabnam was learning new things, and she also remembered how her neighbor had lost her child due to this illness in the past.
"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,73,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 73Shabnam then prepared the ORS for her brother.
* One glass (200 ml) of water, add a pinch of salt and a spoon of sugar.
++
When Shabnam’s mother returned home in the evening, she informed the ASHA (Sarita) about 
Ali’s illness. Sarita was very impressed with Shabnam’s knowledge and said that she had done 
the right thing by giving home based ORS to Ali. Sarita also informed them that diarrhoea can 
happen because of taking food with unclean hands, taking uncovered food and unclean water and because of transmission by faecal - oral route. She also informed them about some danger 
signs to identify severe dehydration, (like lethargy or unconsciousness, sunken eyes, inability to 
drink or drinking poorly, skin pinch going back slowly) requires urgent referral to health facility 
while rehydrating the child with frequent sips of ORS/ fluids on the way to facility. However, if 
the baby is restless or irritable, with sunken eyes, drinks eagerly or is thirsty and skin pinch goes back slowly, it indicates some dehydration, and if the child is given fluids and food along with 
continued breastfeeding, it helps in recovery.   
She also told them some important and useful things for babies over 6 months of age:
Rehydration is adequate when the baby has a normal urine output (eg. 5-6 times a day).•	
Additional solutions like dal and rice starch can be given to children who are not vomiting. •	
Other infection can also be associated with diarrhoea - measles, pneumonia, malaria•	
Breastfeeding/feeding should be continued during illness (like diarrhoea).•	
Proper hand washing can help in prevention of diarrhoea.•	
 One ORS packet should  be dissolved in one litre of clean drinking water [* Packets of ORS •	
which have expired or are damaged (lumping, turning brown, and difficulty in dissolving) 
should be discarded}]
Safe handling of drinking water should be ensured.•	
ASHA demonstrated ORS preparation to Shabnam’s mother and left 2 packets of ORS for Ali 
for further use. Shabnam’s mother was very happy that because of Shabnam’s knowledge her brother could get appropriate advice on time. 
discuss the story:
You will now ask participants to volunteer to do the demonstration of ORS preparation and  z
discuss about identifying damaged ORS packets.

Now ask the participants about what should be done to prevent this problem by using the ‘but  z
how?’ Game. 
You will keep note of all the strategies that the participants have decided for further  z
implementation. 
Discuss with the group that a sick child needs more energy to cope with the illness. Therefore  z
feeding/ breast feeding must be continued during illness and for 2 weeks after recovery. When 
the child has recovered from illness, one additional meal or frequent breast feeding every day 
for the next two weeks will expedite the recovery.
[Now ask a group member to first wash her hands with plain water and then with soap and water 
and save both in separate transparent glass containers. After use of soap she will again wash her hands with plain water and save it in another glass. Let the group see the three glasses and discuss 
what they see. Then talk about the importance of washing hands with soap, that with unwashed 
hands the child eats all the dirt with the food leading to diarrhoea, and that it is important to wash 
hands before eating and cooking, and also washing vegetables and fruits before cutting and eating. 
Hand washing should also be ensured after defecation and cleaning a child after defecation]

Mina had a 3 year old daughter and a 5 year old son. Before going to work in the field daily, 
she cooked food for the family. In her hurry to go for work, she cooked the vegetables without washing them properly. She also fed both the children before leaving for work without washing her hands with soap. Her daughter played by herself all day in the mud in the courtyard and often complained of itching in her toes. When Mina visited the VHND, the ANM said that her daughter was very thin, though her abdomen was swollen and she was undernourished.  Mina  said that she ate 4-5 times a day, yet she looked weak. The ANM then asked her a few things- 
“do you wash your hands with soap before cooking?” 
“do you clean the vegetables before cutting them?” “do you clean your hands with soap after you clean the children after defecation?” 
 The ANM then said “If you have not been doing these things then your child may have worms 
in her stomach.  All children over the age of 1 year should be treated for worms at 6 monthly 
intervals” says the ANM and she gave de-worming syrup to both the children. Mina was satisfied that she now knows the causes of her child’s problems."

Aman was 11 months old and weak since birth. He would often sleep near the open fire (Chula) when 
his mother Malika cooked food. When he had running nose, cough and fever, Malika massaged oil 
mixed with garlic. However his condition did not improve. Over next two days he developed fever 
and his breathing became faster than usual. Mallika’s other children requested her to take them to the fair in their village to which she agreed. That same night Aman developed high fever. 
Next day when Shilpa, the ASHA of the village came to remind about Aman’s missed vaccination 
of measles and vitamin A drops, Malika told her that she feared Aman has become ill because of 
the vaccines that he received last time. Shilpa assured her and examined Aman. After counting Aman’s breathing rate, Shilpa told Malika that Aman has severe form of respiratory infection 
and said that they should consult the ANM as soon as possible."

to go to work the next day. 
Aman’s condition worsened as 
he developed fast breathing, 
grunting, nasal flaring and difficulty in breathing. He also 
looked drowsy and refused to 
feed and his mother became worried. Malika hurriedly called 
the ASHA who accompanied 
her to the neighboring PHC where the doctor treated him. 
The doctor told Malika that if she had delayed seeking care, Aman’s condition could have 
become very serious. In future if the baby has cold and cough, he should be taken to the ASHA or ANM for advice and care. He also advised to keep Aman warm and away from dust and 
smoke. He assured the mother that the infection had nothing to do with the vaccination and he 
should be immunized against measles and given vitamin A as per schedule.

DISCUSS AbOUT THE HEALTH RISKS OF EARLY PREGNANCY
Explain that early marriage and early child bearing has various health risks such as:
An adolescent younger than 17 years often has not reached physical maturity and her pelvis  z
may be too narrow to accommodate the baby’s head. In these cases, obstructed delivery and 
prolonged labor are more likely, thereby increasing the risk of haemorrhage, infection, rupture 
of uterus and fistula or even death.
Anaemia is two times more common in adolescent mothers than among older ones. z
Other complications include: z
Premature Birth: Infants born to adolescent mothers are more likely to be premature, low  
birth weight and may suffer consequences of retarded foetal growth.Spontaneous Abortion and Still births: Young adolescents under the age of 15 are more  
likely to experience spontaneous abortion and still births than older women. 
Pre-eclampsia (hypertension during pregnancy): If pre-eclampsia is left uncontrolled, it can  
progress to severe hypertension, seizures, convulsions, and cerebral haemorrhage or even 
death.

and seek advice. The ASHA informed her 
that sometimes unwanted pregnancies 
occur, and women can make a decision regarding abortion. However, most 
women often go to untrained providers 
like, TBA (traditional birth attendant 
(Dai’s) etc) for abortion. The abortion 
methods that are used by untrained providers are unsafe and unhygienic and 
can lead to serious infections and even 
death. ASHA also told her that abortion is safe and legal and can be done at 
a government health centre up to 20 
weeks of pregnancy and that she should first consult her family and that this information would be kept confidential. ASHA then accompanies Anita to the Government hospital for abortion and 
counsels Anita on different methods of contraception.

Some amount of discharge is normal and may vary depending on the menstrual cycle, more  
during the fertile period and it also increases during pregnancy.
If discharge is foul smelling (eg- smell of menstrual blood, fishy odour), thick, curd like, or  
colored green or yellow or red and associated with itching, rashes, sores or burning urination, 
with or without pain in the lower abdomen, or paining during intercourse, then it is a form of 
infection.
Discharge can also indicate certain hormonal problems or cancer. "
PLA Module for ASHA_English,86,"86 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHANow discuss the difference between RTI and STI:
Those infections that pass from one infected person to the other during intercourse are called  z
‘Sexually transmitted infections (STI)’.  Mothers can pass on STIs to babies during delivery process. 
All infection in the reproductive tract are termed as RTI. 
Because STI remains hidden and symptoms take longer to present, the infection is likely to  z
spread to internal organs.
Now discuss about prevention of RTI and STI: 
Personal hygiene, regular bathing, keeping genital area clean and dry  z
Avoiding unprotected sexual activity, use of condoms can prevent both RTI and STI z
Prompt advice from health personnel - ASHA/ANM z

Tarana’s husband had to migrate for work to the city. He used to come home once in a year. He 
had many encounters with sex workers in the city. After five years he became very sick, his weight 
had reduced and he could not work like before. During this period Tarana had also given birth to 
a baby boy who is two years old now. On returning to the village Tarana’ husband became bed ridden and was treated by the informal provider but his condition did not improve. 
Tarana became worried and requested the ANM to see her husband, who advised to take him 
to the district hospital. After examination, he was tested for HIV and the result was positive. The doctor prescribed medicines and advised him to continue treatment and eat nutritious food. He 
also said that there was likelihood that Tarana and her son may also be infected.  When Tarana and 
her son were tested,  she was also found to be HIV positive but her son was negative. The doctor advised her to continue the treatment and come for regular checkup along with her husband.  
Tarana was worried about the future of her family especially about her two year old son.

affect any part of the body but most commonly affects the lungs. It is transmitted from person to 
person through droplets from the throat of the people who has the disease.  Sometimes it can 
spread to other parts of the body, like the abdomen, bones and other internal organs. TB is both 
preventable and curable.
Emphasize that early recognition of TB can help in prompt treatment and is curable only when  z
treatment is taken as advised.
You will narrate the following story using picture cards to help the members gain a basic  z
understanding of TB, its signs and symptoms and the possible causes that lead to this 
disease."

identification of TB patients and high risk population.
When Sara returned home after a month of taking care of her sick father, she was suffering from 
cough and fever. She met the ASHA of her village at the market and told her about the illness. She 
shared that she has had fever and cough for over 20 days now and she becomes breathless with 
routine work. The ASHA suspected that she may have contracted the disease from her parental home and advised her to go to the PHC to give samples of sputum for examination and also for 
an x-ray. In a few days the PHC doctor told Sara that she had tuberculosis, but there was nothing 
to fear because the disease can be cured provided she takes medicines regularly and takes adequate food and rest. 
Since ASHA was trained as the DOTS provider for her village, she assured Sara that she would 
provide TB drugs for the entire duration of 6 months.  She gave free medicines to Sara routinely 
and asked her to repeat the x-ray after completion of treatment.  When Sara went for her x-ray 
after 6 months she found that her lungs were clear and that her disease had been cured. The 
doctor congratulated her and said that it was because of prompt diagnosis and her compliance 
to treatment. Sara thanked the doctor and the ASHA for her support.
discuss the story:
Ask any participant to repeat the story and then help them to understand the causes and effect  z
of the problem and to arrive at the solutions. Now ask the participants about how the problem 
was addressed.
ACTIVITY 5: Identifying possible strategies for implementation:
Following could be some of the possible 
strategies:
There are many things we can do as an  
individual and community to help get rid of TB.
If a person has TB, the best thing she/he  
can do is to complete the full treatment. 
This will not only make the person 
healthier, but will also help prevent the spread of the disease.
The spread can be prevented by  
coughing into ones palm or elbow or 
use any handkerchief/cloth. 
Make sure that the family members  
get tested for TB (even without any 
symptoms) for faster diagnosis and 
early treatment."

Narrate a story highlighiting the causes, symptoms and prevention and management of Malaria. z
Maya lived with her husband and three children. After the rains, water had collected in all the broken pots, 
pot holes in the village and there were a lot of mosquitoes in and around the house. After a few days when her child had fever on alternate days with chills and vomiting, her husband called the faith healer. However, 
the fever continued and within a week all three children had similar fever with vomiting. When returning 
from her work in the field Maya saw a group of women discussing about malaria and she heard the ASHA saying that any fever could be malaria and that can sometimes even lead to death. She also came to know that ASHA could do a blood test and give the medicines. Maya took all the three children to the ASHA, who 
did the blood test and said that all had malaria. She also said that one of them who was very sick had brain 
malaria and needed to be hospitalized. She gave medicines for the two children and accompanied Maya to the hospital for treatment of the third child.  ASHA advised them to use the bed nets while sleeping and also prevent water stagnation for preventing breeding of mosquitoes.  At the time of discharge, the doctor asked if the family used the insecticide treated bed nets that were distributed to all households.  Maya informed 
him that they had received nets but her husband was using it for fishing. To which the doctor said that many 
families get malaria because the bed nets are used for purposes other than sleeping under the mosquito net.  There are many other diseases that are caused by mosquito bites, like, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya, etc. Maya then decided to share this information with other villagers in the group meeting.

Encourage the group members to repeat the story using the picture cards. z
follow the storytelling with the “but why?” game, which will help the members understand the  z
cause and effect of the problem and come up with solutions.
Now ask the participants about what should be done to prevent this problem by using the  ‘but  z
how ?’ You will now inform participants about malaria: z
Malaria is caused by infected mosquitoes that mostly bite during night while sleeping. 
Mosquitoes breed and live in wet conditions and in stagnant water. 
High fever is the commonest symptom, others include – shivering with chills, sweating,  
convulsion, inability to eat or drink, rapid breathing, unconsciousness, paleness of palms, 
tongue and eyelids, headache, nausea, vomiting and flu like symptoms like body ache, 
diarrhoea, etc.  If test is positive, immediate treatment is advised.
full course of anti-malarial medicine should be taken. 
Pregnant women and malnourished children are at a greater risk for getting infected with  
Malaria.
Inform the participants that there are some individual and community responsibilities to prevent 
malaria.
Individual responsibilities:
Use of protective clothing to avoid mosquito bite z
Use of repellents – neem oil, neem leaf  smoke z
Use of insecticide treated bed nets every night, (they are safe to use for Children and pregnant  z
mothers)
Sleeping indoors z

of breeding sites. 
Collect a glass of water from the stagnant water source and show the larva floating in the  z
water. 
Ask the group to identify areas with water stagnation and then ask them what can be done to  z
prevent water stagnation and how to deal with it (these are the strategies) and take note of the 
responses. 
At the end the members can be asked about what they would prefer – preventive  measures or  z
curative measures.
Community responsibilities
Identification:
Identifying breeding sites – stagnant water, clogged drains, roof tops, broken pots, tyres. z
Identifying adult mosquito resting sites – bushes near houses, dark corners inside the house.  z

ACTIVITY 3: Understanding the concepts of sex and gender: Start the discussion by telling the 
participants they will be discussing about gender norms and restrictions that society imposes on 
women and men in different ways through a role play.
Man Woman
The scene opens with one man and a woman standing in the middle of a circle with participants all around.
I’m a man. I’m a man! (twirling his moustache) And I am a woman. (hands folded in front, head bowed 
down)
Everybody here knows how intelligent and powerful I am. (walking around in an arrogant manner) Because the society considers me weak, I feel I am really weak. 
I decide everything in my family. No one can do
anything without my permission. But I am not even allowed to decide about my own life-
choices. 
I can do anything I like, I can roam around with my friends till late in the night, wear the clothes of my choice. (grin-ning)And I have to face so many restrictions - “Don’t do this, don’t go there, don’t talk to him.” Since childhood I have always done what others wanted me to do. After mar -
riage, my in-laws scolded me for food not being ready on time or the salt being a little less, etc."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,97,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 97Man Woman
I can say anything without any restriction because I am a 
man and intelligent and always right.And I’m always told not to talk much.  As a child when I was molested by a relative, I remained quiet, when boys 
harassed me, I said nothing.  And later when I got 
married to an abusive man, I remained quiet because I 
was used to remaining silent.
I always got more food than my sisters as a child. My mother said that I was to take the family 
lineage forward and also perform last rites when they 
died so I needed to be strong.And I was always considered other home’s 
property. Therefore less money was spent and was given 
less food and education. (gets sad and sits down) I be-
longed to neither this nor that house.
(Empathizes and goes near her) Sometimes I feel like helping you with the household work, but then I stop be-cause my friends would make fun of me and my parents would taunt me.I also feel like reaching out to you when you are 
depressed sometimes, but I don’t know how you or your 
family will react.
(Smiles, gets excited and sits up on the knees, holds her hands) Did you know that I love to cook, I used to play 
with my sisters and we cooked tiny pooris and curry, but 
as I grew older, everyone made fun of me.Even I loved to play cricket, and I was very good at 
batting. There goes a six, and that one a four. (laughing). 
But I was stopped because they said girls didn’t play
outdoor games.
I was hurt once and I cried and was told that boys dont 
cry. When I lost my mother at 15 and I cried, everyone told me I shouldn’t be crying like a girl, since then I cry in 
my room alone in the night. In spite of the freedom that 
men have, they don’t have the freedom to cry.(Comforting him with her hand on his shoulder) This 
makes me realise how unfair we are to our children. When my son came to me crying  yesterday after he fell 
down I comforted him saying boys weren’t 
supposed to cry.
What is it about our society that compels us to kill our 
instincts right from our childhood?That which creates this inequality between boys and girls, that which gets men and women against each other?
Patriarchy is because of unequal power relations. Though 
it is linked with greater power with men but it is often practiced by both men and women. It 
actually causes men and women to grow up suffering 
from violence without their even realising it.Can we help to bring about equality 
acknowledging the fundamental difference between men and women?
We can if we learn to treat each other with respect, to 
understand each other’s needs and try to bring about a change in the way society thinks, because we are the society!Children will learn to respect only when we do the same and that way our future generation can change the soci-ety!
Now I understand I’m a human, like other humans. It’s the society that has labeled me a man.I too am only a human. It is the society that has labeled me a woman.
Both Man and Woman come together and hold hands. They say together Yes we are equal and we are humans.
Ask them how they perceive the roles/attributes of men and women. Note down the responses on 
the chart paper using two columns to differentiate them as mentioned in the following table:
Now ask the participants whether these qualities that are attributed to men and women are  
in born i.e. biological or due to socialization because of social factors. 
Probe for attributes that are not inborn but generally believed to be so and emphasize that  
the process of socialization is largely responsible for an individual’s development. These 
values are inculcated in girls and boys as a child to behave in a typical framework as deemed 
fit by the society. 
Now ask if the above attributes can be inter-changed.  
You can engage them by asking questions like - “but can men be emotional?” etc.    
This could lead to a discussion on society’s reaction to men who cry and demonstrate   
their emotions and their expectations of men’s behavior."
PLA Module for ASHA_English,98,"98 | PARTICIPATORY LEARNING AND A CTION (PLA) MODULE fOR ASHA fACILITATOR/ASHASum up the discussion by saying that these attributes are interchangeable and emphasize  
that sex has to do with biological and genetic matters and is not interchangeable,  whereas 
gender refers to socially constructed roles, responsibilities and expectations of men and 
women in a given culture or society. These roles, responsibilities and expectations are learnt from family, friends, communities, opinion leaders, religious institutions, schools, workplace, 
advertisements and the media.
ACTIVITY 4: T he life cycle of violence in women
Inform the participants that violence is rooted in social structures and is prevalent in all classes of society. It affects women cutting across age groups, cultures, religions, socio- economic strata, 
educational and geographical backgrounds. While it is commonly believed that it is men who inflict violence on women, this is not always true. It is possible for men to experience gender based 
violence also. However, most gender based violence is directed at women and girls. Often women 
face abuse and harassment by male as well as female members of their household and most violence takes place in the confines of the home or neighbourhood. 
Now the participants will identify different types of gender-based violence that occurs at different 
times in a woman’s life cycle.
Prenatal  
Sex selective

Infancy
Depriving new born girl 
of breast milk, giving

Not providing adequate nutrition or unequal food provision, compared to boys in the family, 
depriving them of health care, denial of access to life skills education programme and recreational activities, forced childhood marriages, sexual abuse and trafficking for abuse and labour.  Adult
Verbal abuse, physical violence, repeated 
fault finding, compelling women to engage in humiliating acts often in public, blaming and shaming for giving birth to a girl child, forced abortion, acid attacks, denial of opportunities, limiting access to health care, restricting movements, rape in marriage or otherwise, dowry related harassment, sexual harassment at work place sexual harassment either online or through mobiles, cell phone etc.  
Adolescence
Eve teasing, molestation, rape, sexual 
harassment, trafficking, kidnapping, forced prostitution, early marriages, denial of education and life skill opportunities, limited exposure for self development, honour killing, sexual harassment either online or through mobiles, cell phones etc.  Six Stages of violence in Woman’s Life"
PLA Module for ASHA_English,99,"MEETINGS ON MATERNAL AND NEwbORN HEALTH  | 99Using the flex on the life cycle of violence in women’s lives, you will ask questions like, what kind  z
of violence does she face in her childhood, at birth, as a married woman or as an old woman? 
After each picture has been explained, emphasize that violence permeates every phase of her  z
life. Probe for different forms of violence. Violence is not only physical but also mental, emotional, economical and sexual. Some invisible  z
aspects of violence like verbal abuse, denial of food, education, mobility, resources etc. are also 
termed as violence. One act may have several of these forms, like sexual harassment is physical, 
emotional, and mental and sexual violence.
Some acts of violence are obvious and visible in society while some acts of emotional and  z
economic violence are not even perceived as violence. 
They need to understand that instances of violence happening every day against women in their  z
community can be and needs to be prevented in future. 
Note: 
“Domestic Violence is one of the most common forms of violence against women. It is inflicted by 
the husband or other close family members. This is frequently invisible since it happens behind 
closed doors and often the community does not treat it as a type of violence but considers it as a “private family matter”. 
Refer to the training module – Handbook for ASHAs – Mobilizing for action on violence against 
women for discussions during this meeting.

MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),1,"Introduction  |  1Over the years, we have seen improvements in health status of the community. You as an ASHA 
have played a key role in improving health outcomes of mother and children. This includes an 
increase in institutional deliveries, immunization coverage, improvements in infant and child health, 
and reductions in maternal and infant deaths. You were at the forefront for providing services for  
COVID-19 pandemic and have been instrumental in provision of services for communicable disease like TB, malaria, leprosy. You have also been trained recently in care for non-communicable diseases 
and have initiated work for helping people in the community to prevent NCDs, identify and support 
those who are affected by these diseases.
Now, as a country we have made progress in improving maternal and child health and communicable 
diseases. However, we are facing additional challenges. In order to address these challenges, Ayushman Bharat– Health and Wellness Centres have been rolled out across the country. The basket 
of services at primary care level is expanded. One of the additional service packages is related to 
Mental health. 
You might have come across or heard about mental health disorders in your community. This can 
include people with complaints of unusual constant fear or long-lasting sad mood or some who might exhibit symptoms like hearing voice when no one is talking. These are only some types of mental health disorders. There are other disorders like excess use of alcohol, epilepsy, loss of memory, 
suicidal behaviour etc. Although they might be classified as mental, neurological (related to brain) 
and substance use disorders, we would term them as mental health disorders, for the purpose of 
this module. 
These health challenges have been persistent and have increased over the years. These are also 
particularly sensitive topics as there is stigma and discrimination in the community against those 
who show any of the associated symptoms. 
This module will tell you more about these mental health disorders. It will guide you on how you 
can help people in the community who are suffering from any of these disorders. It would also help 
you to facilitate prevention of mental health disorders and reduce the stigma about mental health disorders. 
As an ASHA, you are in the unique position of being able to reach every individual and family. Over 
time, you have gained credibility and respect in the community. This module builds on your existing 
knowledge and skills by providing you with new information and skills.Introduction"

A mentally healthy person
can think clearly 9
can enjoy good relationships with others 9
can cope with the normal stresses of life and solve problems 9
can work productively and make contributions to the community 9
Mental health is vital for individuals, families and communities, and is more than just an absence of 
disorder. You have learned about physical health over the years and as we know, a healthy person 
needs to have both mental and physical health. These two are related to each other. Mental health 
provides individuals with the energy for active living, achieving goals and interacting with people in a fair and respectful way.
What are mental health disorders?
The mind can fall ill just as physical body. In these disorders, the person’s capability to feel, to think, to work, to enjoy relationships and to cope with stresses is affected in a negative way. These are real 
medical illnesses and include broad range of symptoms. 
As we discussed before, mental and physical health are related to each other because, our minds 
and body are interlinked. If the mind is stressed it affects the body and on the other hand, our body 
(physical complaints) affects our mind.
What are some of the positive feelings/emotions you experience?
Happy, Content, ProudWhat are some negative feelings/emotions you experience?Sad, Tensed/stressed, Fear, HopelessnessCan you name/describe one situation when you have felt these emotions?

Mental health disorders can affect both men and women, and can affect people from  ~
different age groups including the young and the elderly. CHAPTER  1

Mental Health Disorders
"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),4,"4  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Introduction to Mental Health and Mental Health Disorders  |  5Mental health disorders are common – about one in five adults experience a mental health  ~
disorder at some stage in their life.
Most people suffering from a mental health disorder look the same as everyone else. It’s not  ~
always possible to tell that someone is experiencing a mental health disorder just by looking 
at the person.
Mental health disorders include a variety of different conditions ranging from more common  ~
problems such as excessive fear and worry (anxiety), repeated unwanted thoughts, images, 
impulses and actions causing distress or anxiety to the individual or unusually sad mood 
(depression), to more severe behavioral problems that can involve suspiciousness, violence, 
agitation and other unusual behaviours (psychosis).
Mental health disorders are more than just the experience of stress. Although stressful life  ~
events often contribute to the development of mental health disorders, stress itself is not 
considered to be a mental health disorder but may lead which need to be addressed.
A mental health disorder can be a brief episode or it may be a long-term persistent  ~
condition. These disorders affect the quality of life. People with a mental health disorder are often 
 ~
unable to enjoy their life or to function as expected in the community (e.g., doing the 
household chores, going to work).
If anyone individual in a family has any of the disorders, other family members also undergo  ~
a lot of stress.  
For ease of understanding, the disorders are classified in six major groups.
Common Mental Disorders– It is quite common to suffer from an unusually long-lasting 1. 
sad mood (we call this Depression) or unusually strong fear or worries (we call this Anxiety 
Disorder).
Severe Mental Disorders– A person may have unreal experiences such as hearing voices in 2. 
absence of anyone speaking (hallucinations) and unreal beliefs such as thinking that there 
is a conspiracy to kill him which may lead a person to behave in a strange way (we call this Psychoses).
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Disorders– These are specific to the age group, for 3. 
example, some children can develop slower than other children or show behaviours causing 
problems.
Neurological conditions– These affect our brains and include epilepsy and dementia. When 4. 
a person has several seizures, we call this Epilepsy. Old people may develop dementia, which 
means loss of memory. E.g. they may forget the names of their family members and not find their house anymore. 
Substance Use Disorder– A person may consume too much harmful substances like alcohol, 5. 
tobacco or other illegal substances like ganja, hashish etc. Suicide ideation/behaviours– An individual who is feeling unusually sad or has prolonged feeling 6. 
of sadness and hopelessness may end his/her life. This is called suicide ideation or behaviour. 
You will learn more about each of these types in detail in chapter 4. 
As you can see, there are different kinds of mental health disorders. It is important to know about the 
causes and factors associated with these disorders. Understanding these factors would help you in 
clearing the misconceptions around these disorders and create awareness about the same in your community. "
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),5,"Introduction to Mental Health and Mental Health Disorders  |  5Causes of mental health disorders
There is rarely one single cause of a mental health disorder. Most mental health disorders are caused 
by a combination of factors (figure 1) including,
Stressful life events ~
Biological factors ~
Individual psychological factors e.g. poor self-esteem, negative thinking ~
Adverse life experiences during childhood e.g. abuse, neglect, death of parents or other  ~
traumatic experiences.
Some people may be more vulnerable to mental health disorders than others but may not develop an illness until they are exposed to stressful life events.
Biological factors can include genetics, brain injury, and chemical imbalance in the brain. Sometimes 
people experiencing chronic medical problems such as heart, kidney and liver failure, and diabetes may develop mental health problems such as depression, as living with a chronic illness can be very stressful.
Stressful life events can contribute to the development of mental health disorders e.g. family 
conflicts, unemployment, death of a loved one, money problems, infertility and violence. A lot of stress may also contribute to an imbalance of chemicals in the brain.
Poverty can place a person at risk of mental health disorders because of the stresses associated 
with low levels of education, poor housing and low income. Mental health disorders are also more 
difficult to cope with in conditions of poverty.
Difficulties in childhood such as sexual or physical violence, emotional neglect, or early death of a 
parent can sometimes lead to a mental health disorder later in life.
Unhealthy behaviours such as drug and alcohol abuse can lead to the development of a mental 
health disorder as well as being the result of a mental health disorder.

Mental health disorders often become chronic if they are not treated. There are effective, safe and 
affordable treatments to treat mental health disorders. Common Mental Disorders are primarily 
treated with counselling, and Severe Mental Disorders are primarily treated with medicines. There 
are many ways the person with the mental health disorders and the family can help themselves. 
There are some misconceptions about treatment of mental health disorders. Such common 
treatments or responses that do NOT help a person with a mental health disorder are as follows–
ignoring or avoiding the person ~
believing the symptoms will just go away ~
locking the person away ~
being angry with him/her ~
relying exclusively on practitioners who use magic or faith healing ~
arranging a marriage if they are unmarried, with a belief that marriages will cure their mental  ~
illness
giving sleeping tablets or appetite stimulants, toddy, alcohol believing that you can cure the  ~
person or that you have all the solutions to their problems neglecting treatment and follow 
up (poor compliance)
Myths and Misconceptions about mental health disorders
These false beliefs are widespread within the communities and can delay early recognition and treatment of a mental health disorders. These misconceptions further increase the discrimination 
and stigma around mental health disorders. As an ASHA, you will have a key role in dispelling these 
myths and improving the mental health of the community (Stigma and discrimination will be discussed in detail in Chapter 2 of Mental Health Promotion). 
Some of the common myths and the facts are as follows:
Myth Fact
Mental illness is caused by evil spirit or 
supernatural power.Biological, psychological and social factors are responsible for the causation of mental illness.
Mental illnesses are untreatable. Mental illnesses are treatable with proper treatment and counselling.
Lack of willpower causes mental illness. Willpower does get affected due to mental illness but is not a cause of mental illness.
Marriage can cure mental illness. Marriage cannot cure mental illness; it can act as a stressor.
Mentally ill patients belong to hospitals. Majority of persons with mental illness can be treated at out-patient settings or primary care settings. 
Mental health problems are only seen in illiterate, poor people.Mental health problems may occur to anybody, irrespective of caste, education or class.
People with mental illness can never be productive or do normal work like normal people.People with mental illness on regular treatment and supervision, can very well lead a productive and qualitative life like any other normal person."
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),7,"Introduction to Mental Health and Mental Health Disorders  |  7Myth Fact
Mental illness is unlike physical illness; the 
illness is really all in person’s head.Mental illness is just like physical illness since both are biologically based.
Mentally ill people have weak characters since they can’t cope with the world in the same way that the rest of us do.The Development of mental illness has nothing to do with person’s character. Mental illness strikes people with all kinds of backgrounds, beliefs, temperament and morals.
Once a psychiatric patient, always a psychiatric patient.A psychiatric patient, with proper treatment, can improve and function well enough in society, if given the right conditions and opportunities.
Children don’t suffer from psychiatric illnesses.Children too get affected by mental illness.
Mental health disorders are a result of bad parenting.Bad parenting does not lead to mental illness but may have some role in relapse, and can be a risk factor.
Mental illnesses are contagious. Mental illnesses are not contagious.
Attempting suicide is a sign of cowardice. Suicide usually is attempted by someone who is depressed and not because he/she is a coward.
Mentally ill patients are violent and dangerous.Few patients with severe psychotic illness may become violent at times, but otherwise not all patients are violent."
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),8,"8  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Mental Health Promotion  |  9Health promotion is the process of enabling people to increase control over and improve their 
health. Such activities are geared toward promoting health in the population as a whole. Health 
promotion is not just the responsibility of health workers, it is a coordinated action that involves and 
benefits the whole community. 
You have been part of health promotion activities for reproductive and child health, communicable 
diseases and social determinants of health like sanitation through community platforms like VHSNC/MAS.
Similarly, activities towards improving mental health of community will lead to Mental Health 
promotion. These will increase the state of awareness, attitude and knowledge of the community 
regarding mental health issues.
What is included in mental health promotion?
Promoting harmony in the community through social networking ~
Reducing levels of violence in the community ~
Ensuring people are free from stigma and discrimination ~
Promoting the rights of people with a mental health disorder ~
Engaging in improving the facilities available for the treatment of mental health disorders  ~
in the community
Educating people and increasing the knowledge of the community about mental health  ~
disorders
Stigma and discrimination
Stigma is a mark of shame, disgrace or disapproval, which results in an individual being shunned 
or rejected by others (World Health Organization). Discrimination is the unfair and less favourable 
treatment towards those who are stigmatized. People may be discriminated for different reasons, 
e.g. their race, gender or caste. Stigma and discrimination may lead to isolation and humiliation. 
Why is there stigma and discrimination?
People with mental health disorder are sometimes stigmatised and discriminated against  ~
because they think and behave differently.Mental Health PromotionCHAPTER  2"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),9,"Mental Health Promotion  |  9Not knowing the facts about mental health disorders sometimes makes people afraid of  ~
those having any symptoms of mental disorders.
How does stigma and discrimination affect a person with a mental health disorder?
A person suffering from a mental health disorder may be rejected by friends, relatives,  ~
neighbours and employers.
A person who is rejected may then feel more lonely and unhappy and this will make recovery  ~
even more difficult.Stigma also affects the family and caretakers of a person with a mental health disorder and 
 ~
may lead to isolation and humiliation.Stigma can cause delays in seeking treatment for a family member with a mental health 
 ~
disorder.
How can stigma and discrimination be reduced?
People with mental disorders should be seen as active and valuable members of the  ~
community.Openly talk about mental health disorders in the community to help people understand that a 
 ~
person with a mental disorder is a fellow human being and is entitled to be valued as such.Provide accurate information to family members and community groups on what causes 
 ~
mental health disorders, how common they are, and that they can be treated.Counter negative stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding mental health disorders by 
 ~
educating people about the following points.
Mental health disorders are a bit like an illness of the mind. ¡
Having a mental health disorder is not a character weakness or a result of being  ¡
deliberately lazy or difficult.Mental disorders are not the result of curses, black magic or evil spirits.
 ¡
Anyone can suffer from a mental health disorder. ¡
People with a mental health disorder often need help to recover. ¡
A person with a mental health disorder can hold a job and get married. ¡
Most people with mental health disorders are not violent. ¡
Provide support and treatment for people suffering from mental health disorders so that  ~
they can meaningfully participate in community life.A community that respects and protects basic civil, political, economic, social, and cultural 
 ~
rights is essential for promoting mental health and reducing stigma and discrimination.
Mental health disorders and vulnerable groups in the community
There are certain social groups who are more likely to experience mental disorders and have limited 
access to care due to vulnerability. 
Poverty and Mental health disorders
People living in poverty are more likely to experience mental health disorders due to the stresses associated with being poor, and mental health disorders are likely to worsen poverty, so that it 
becomes a vicious cycle. (Figure 2)"

pressures of poverty, and

Women, gender inequality and violence
As you know, there are inequalities between men and women in society. These are observed in 
different fields such as access to health services, jobs, violence. You have also learnt about this in 
your module on ‘Gender based Violence’ . Most common form of violence against women occurs 
in domestic context. The violence can be physical, verbal, sexual, emotional and financial. Violence leads to physical and mental health problems in women. 
How is gender related to mental health? Can the reasons include any of the following-?
Men do not discuss their problems with friends and find solutions as much as women. ¡
It is more acceptable for men, to drink alcohol leading to more problem drinking in men and more  ¡
stigma for women who have a drinking problem.
Domestic violence and rape can place great stress on the life of a woman. ¡
Women’s income is often lower than that of men, and they have less control over household  ¡
finances. Women may not be able to independently access treatment unless there is agreement from senior  ¡
members (whether male or female) of the household.A woman cannot receive needed health services because norms in her community prevent her  ¡
from travelling alone to a clinic. Families may be more reluctant to spend money on treatment for females compared to males. ¡
Women are more prone to mental illness following stress like diabetics, child birth,  ¡
menopause"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),11,"Mental Health Promotion  |  11What can be done to promote mental health for men and women? 
Two actions to help promote mental health for men and women include,
Empowering men and women to make decisions that influence their own lives. ~
Educating people about the need for equal rights for men and women. ~
“Gender equality means women and men have equal opportunities to realise their 
individual potential, to contribute to their country’s economic and social development

symptoms of mental health disorder. If you recognize such symptoms in any individual, your first 
step would be to encourage the individual for accessing medical care at nearest healthcare facility. 
You have an important role in providing assistance and helping the individuals to seek appropriate help. At the same time, you will need to provide basic care till such medical care is available. This help is called ‘Psychological First Aid or Mental Health First Aid’
It is similar to first aid for any physical illness. When a person has an acute physical illness, it can be 
addressed in the short-term with first aid treatments, such as treatment for snake bite. Mental health 
disorders can also be addressed initially with first aid.
Mental Health First Aid is the help you give to a person with a mental health problem until treatment 
by a trained doctor/mental health specialist is available or a mental health crisis is resolved. The purpose of this first aid is to–
Preserve life when a person may be a danger to him/herself or others
 9
Provide comfort to the person and relieve for some symptoms 9
Ensure further professional treatment 9
Essential steps in Mental Health First Aid are–
Listen without judgement 1. 
Assess risk of suicide and harm to self to others 2. 
Give reassurance and information 3. 
Encourage the person to get appropriate 4. 
professional help
Encourage self-help treatments, follow up and 5.

1. Listen without judgement
Listen to what the person describes without being critical or thinking they are weak.  ~
Don’t give advice such as ‘just cheer up’ or ‘pull yourself together’ . ~
Don’t forcefully question and avoid getting into an argument with the person. ~Mental Health First Aid  
(Psychological First Aid)CHAPTER  3"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),13,"Mental Health First Aid  (Psychological First Aid)  |  132. Assess the risk of suicide or harm to self or others
People with mental health disorders sometimes feel so overwhelmed and helpless about their 
life, the future appears hopeless. They might want to end their life. You can engage the person in conversation about how they are feeling and let them describe why they are feeling this way. Ask the 
person if they are having thoughts of suicide. If they are, find out if they have a plan for suicide. This 
is not a bad question to ask someone who is mentally unwell. It is important to find out if he/she is having these thoughts in order to refer him/her for help.
If you believe the person is at risk of harming him/herself then,
don’t leave the person alone
 9
seek immediate help from someone who knows about mental health disorders 9
try to remove the person from access to the means of taking their own life 9
try to stop the person continuing to use alcohol or drugs. 9
3. Give reassurance and information It is important that the individual and family members are reassured and have right information 
about the condition, including care options. You can,
Tell the patient that he/she has a real medical condition
 9
Tell the person that it is not a shame or weakness of character to have a mental health  9
disorder
Assure the person that there are effective treatments available 9
Inform the person that recovery may take a bit of time 9
Ensure the person that you are there to help and to follow up 9
4. Encourage the person to get appropriate professional help
As an ASHA, you can encourage the person to consult with Community Health Officer (CHO) or 
Medical Officer, who knows about mental health disorders. Then you can follow-up by giving 
ongoing support to the person and his/her family. 
If the person is very unwell i.e. you think they are suicidal or psychotic, (harmful to self/ others) and 
he/she is refusing to get any help from a doctor, encourage the family to consult with the CHO/MO 
so that they can explain the situation and get professional support.
5.  Suggest actions that the person can perform him/herself that can help relieve the symptoms 
of mental health disorder such as:
getting enough sleep 9
eating a healthy diet 9
regular exercise 9
relaxation and breathing exercises e.g.  9
yoga
avoiding alcohol /other substance  9
(tobacco, ganja etc)joining support groups for women, men

Role of family/caregiver in supporting individuals with mental health disorders
In most cases the family provides the majority of support and care for a person with a mental health disorder. Living with and caring for someone with a mental disorder can be very stressful, therefore 
it is important that the family receives help and support to care for their ill relative (like for someone 
with a physical illness). The family usually will provide you with important information about the person with the mental health disorder. Families often don’t understand the symptoms of a mental health disorder; therefore, the family members may unintentionally increase the stress for the person 
with the mental illness
"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),16,"16  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  17Family members’ behaviour has positive or negative impact on the stress of person with mental 
health disorder. Certain behaviours can increase the stress of the individual, such as calling the 
person lazy or an embarrassment to the family, shouting or using critical tone of voice, or being 
over-protective, such as doing everything for the person or treating him/her like a child. 
On the other hand, if family members are communicating in a clear and calm way and discussing 
the problems openly, giving the person space, especially when he/she is tense and allowing or encouraging the person to take responsibility of their own affairs can decrease the stress of the individual. 
You can encourage involvement of family during care for individual with mental health disorder. 
In many cases the person with mental health disorder will be accompanied by a family member. Sometimes the family member has taken the initiative to seek help. If a family member wants to talk to you confidentially always ask the person with the mental health disorder for permission. If a person 
comes by him/herself ask him/her if you may call a close family member for further information and 
collaboration (who is there to help the person?). At the same time, it is important that the family members are maintaining some of their own interests and not devoting their lives exclusively to the person (this will make the family feel less stressed). 
How to support the family/caregiver of individuals with mental health disorders?
Listen carefully ~
Give reassurance and information ~
Tell them where to get professional help (as you would do it for the person with mental  ~
health disorder)
Assure your support ~
Tell them about the behaviours which may lead to increase in the stress and also behaviours  ~

How to recognize and help?CHAPTER  4
In this chapter, you will learn about how to recognize and help individuals experiencing any 
symptoms related to different types of mental health disorders. 
1. Common Mental Disorders
What are common mental disorders?
These include depression/tension/stress and anxiety disorders. 
Depression/ Tension/ Stress: We all experience short-term sad moods (e.g., when we have an  ~
argument with someone, when we feel lonely, when we fail an exam). Sadness becomes an illness when it lasts for a prolonged period or starts to interfere with our daily activities and 
relationships. It is termed as depression. 
Anxiety disorders: We all experience worry and fear in certain situations (e.g., when we have 
 ~
to perform something new). Fear is a natural reaction to danger and helps us to activate our 
energies (e.g., in the old days to run away from a wild animal). Fear becomes a mental health 
disorder when it is long-lasting or starts to interfere with our daily activities and relationships. 
It is called as ‘anxiety disorder’ .
How will recognize that someone has common mental disorder?
The person may complain about,
Sleeping problems or feeling tired or weak ~
Loss of interest in regular activities ~
Different physical problems and aches ~
The person may appear,
A bit slow in movement and thinking ~
With a sad or worried expression on the face ~
Restless (e.g., fidgeting with hands) ~"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),18,"18  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  19An individual may experience any of the following symptoms
Symptom 1: An unusually sad mood or extensive fear remains longer 
than 2 weeks
Feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness or negative thinking  
about him/herself (‘I can’t enjoy anything anymore’ , ‘I am a 
failure’ , ‘I am a burden’ , ‘I did everything wrong’ , ‘it’s my fault’ , ‘it will never get better’)
Unreasonable fears (e.g., the permanent worry that a family  
member might get ill, recurrent attacks of fear in certain 
situations)
Thoughts to be better off dead (suicidal thoughts) 
Symptom 3: Complaints that interfere with at 
least one of the person’s daily activities
The person spends a lot of time at home  
or in bed
The person is unable to go to work or do  
the householdThe person withdraws from his/her  
familySymptom 2: Physical complaints
Different aches (e.g., headache,   
back-pain, stomach-ache)
Sleeping problems 
Loss of appetite 
Tiredness and loss of energy 
Palpitations, sweating, restlessness 
CASE  1 
During a home visit to Mr. Raju’s house, the family tells the ASHA that Mr. Raju has become very withdrawn, 
confining himself to his bed most of the day, saying that he is feeling very tired if his family asks him what is wrong, and not taking any interest in family activities. During the recent village festival, he had refused to take the lead in the arrangements (which he used to regularly do before), saying he is feeling tired and does not feel like it. When the frontline health worker talked to Mr. Raju, he said that he has no strength to do anything and just wants to lie down, he is feeling very sad and feels there is no future, and that he does not feel like living anymore.
What can be the probable disorder in the above scenarios? What are the main features that point to the 
disorder?
Tool for assessing depression 
You are aware about Community Based Risk Assessment (CBAC) checklist. You have used it for 
assessing risk factors for common non communicable diseases. As part of this CBAC, you would 
additionally ask two questions related to depression. You will administer it to individuals of age 
30 years and above, like before. These two questions are called ‘PHQ-2’ questions and are as follows–
"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),19,"Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  19PHQ-2
Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been 
bothered by the following problems?Not at allSeveral daysMore than half the daysNearly every day
1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 0 +1 +2 +3
2. Feeling down, depressed or hopeless? 0 +1 +2 +3
Total Score
Anyone with total score greater than 3 should be referred to CHO/MO (PHC/UPHC)
The purpose of ‘PHQ-2’ is to screen for symptoms related to depression. After administering the PHQ-2, 
you will refer the individuals who have scored more than 3 to SHC-HWC. Community Health Officer 
(CHO) at SHC-HWC will ask the individuals more detailed questions to understand about the symptoms. 
CHO will ask questions from a detailed tool called ‘PHQ-9’ to these individuals and provide appropriate advice. The individual will be provided help at SHC-HWC or can be referred to PHC-MO by CHO. 
 Remember
Questions included in PHQ-2 are only for screening and not for purpose of diagnosis. 
Diagnosis for depression would be confirmed by Medical officer/ specialist. 
Anxiety disorders
As you have learnt previously in this chapter, anxiety disorders are a 
group of disorders characterised by feeling of severe anxiety, worry 
or fear which interfere with daily living and behaviour. Along with the 
feeling of fear and worry there are often physical symptoms, as follows:
Physical symptoms: 
Headache,  ~
Sleep disturbances (especially difficulty in falling sleep),  ~
Heart beating fast, dry mouth, dizziness, sweating (panic attack) ~
The person feels,
Restless,  ~
Trembling,  ~
Inability to relax,  ~
Excessive worries about future misfortunes. ~
Irritable/ anxious/ nervous ~
Commonly, anxiety disorders include the following.Generalized anxiety disorder: There is feeling of predominant tension, worry and apprehension about 
everyday events and problems. This is accompanied by one or more symptoms such as palpitations, chest tightness, sweating, difficulty in breathing, abdominal distress, light-headedness, etc. which 
cause significant emotional distress.
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): This occurs after exposure to stressful life events such as death 
of a near one, natural disaster, accident, etc. These can cause distress in anyone, but in PTSD there is 
repeated remembering or repeated bad dreams about the event which interferes with daily living.
"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),20,"20  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  21Panic disorders: There are recurrent panic attacks which often occur spontaneously without any trigger.
Panic attack 
Panic attack is a sudden attack of extreme fear, typically happening without any forewarning when 
a person is in a crowd of people.
Symptoms may include,
Sudden feeling of heart beating fast ~
Feeling dizzy or light-headed ~
Having hot flushes, chills or trembling ~
Experiencing a feeling of choking or shortness of breath ~
Breathing too fast (hyperventilation) ~
Being afraid to die, to faint or to lose control ~
A panic attack usually stops by itself in around 15 minutes and it is not dangerous and does not 
cause any physical harm. However, it would be difficult to differentiate it from similar symptoms due 
to physical ill health. Identifying stressors in such cases can help in recognizing a panic attack. 
CASE  2:  
Pandu is a 19 year old young man who lost his parents when he was still a young boy. He is living with his 
older brothers’ family. The money is scarce. Pandu has been searching for a job since quite a while, but without any formal education he has not been able to find any work so far. Pandu would also like to get married soon but without having a job he doesn’t see any chances to find a wife.
Pandu gradually felt more and more overwhelmed by worries and would sometimes wake up at night 
sweating and feeling his heart racing. He couldn’t find a good night sleep anymore and felt increasingly weak during the day. He felt more and more hopeless about the future and started to think he might be better off dead and not be a burden on his brother any more. One day Pandu tried to end his life by consuming poison (pesticides), but luckily his brother found him in time.
A panic attack needs treatment, when a person starts to suffer from re-occurring episodes (many 
people will experience one or two panic attacks during their lifetime) or when a person starts to avoid 
certain situations (e.g., taking a bus) because he/she fears another attack in the same situation. A 
person suffering from anxiety disorder may feel helpless and want to end his/her life and professional help is required in such cases.
 Remember
Anyone can get a Common Mental Disorder  
About 1-2 out of 10 people will experience symptoms of a Common Mental Disorder during their  
lifetime 
Women are affected by a Common Mental Disorder more often than men  
Social stress increases the risk of developing a Common Mental Disorder  
Sensitive personality, low self-esteem (thoughts that one is not as good as others are), difficult  
childhood may make a person more vulnerable Person in whose family somebody has/had a Common Mental Disorder may be at a higher risk "
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),21,"Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  21How to help the people showing these symptoms?
If you recognize anyone with such symptoms, your role would be to give reassurance to the individual 
and family and then encourage the person to visit a healthcare provider (CHO at SHC-HWC or MO 
at PHC).
CHO would further screen and refer the individual to Medical Officer as appropriate. MO or specialist 
can confirm the diagnosis. 
As an ASHA, you should know the treatment options available for these disorders. These are as follows–
Mental Health First Aid including basic counselling and encouraging self-help-treatments  ~
(by ASHAs, MPW-F, CHO)
Advanced Counselling involving more Psychoeducation and Problem-solving (by PHC-MO) ~
Psychotherapy (by specialist) ~
Medicines (by PHC-MO or specialist) ~
Before referral to the CHO, you can also help the individual by providing psychological first aid–
Listen without judgement 1. 
Listen to the actual complaints the person is presenting to you. ¡
Ask for any live stressors, actual problems worrying the person. ¡
Engage the person in discussing how he/she is feeling emotionally. ¡
Listen with an open mind and don’t judge anything of what the person is telling you. ¡
Assess the risk for suicide 2. 
Always ask for suicidal thoughts. ¡
If yes, ask the person if he/she has a concrete plan to kill him/herself. ¡
Seek immediate help if the person has any concrete plans and don’t leave the person alone. ¡
Remember that people with CMD are at high risk for suicidal behaviour.  ¡
Give reassurance and information 3. 
Inform the individuals that, a common mental disorder is a real illness like a physical illness. ¡
Assure the person that it is not due to laziness or weakness of character. ¡
Give hope: tell the person that a common mental disorder can be treated successfully. ¡
Encourage the person to get appropriate help from healthcare providers 4. 
Tell the person which kind of help is available  ¡
Assist the person to reach facility (inform the CHO prior to visit) ¡
Encourage the individual to adopt some self-help treatments. Give advice– 5. 
For a healthy diet (people with CMD often suffer a lack of Appetite or some craving for  ¡
unhealthy foods like sweets)
To engage in enjoyable activities (e.g. listening to music) ¡
To exercise regularly ¡
To practice regular relaxation (e.g. yoga, breathing exercise) ¡
To stay away from alcohol, tobacco or sleeping pills (people with CMD may take too  ¡
much of these substances)
To speak to a friend or family member ¡"

A panic attack may look like a heart or asthma attack, if you are unsure what is wrong with the 
person call the ambulance/doctor (especially when it is an older person) 
If possible, move the person to a calm place.  ~
Encourage the person to breathe slowly in unison with your own breathing (e.g., breathe  ~
in for 3 seconds (count slowly 1, 2, 3), then breathe out for 3 seconds until the person calm down bit and start to feel better. Remember: Breathing exercises are the most effective 
management of panic attacks and should not be delayed.
Explain the person that he/she is experiencing a panic attack and that it is not dangerous 
 ~
and not causing any physical harm. 
You may now ask the person if he/she had recent stress.  ~
Listen carefully, don’t judge.  ~
Stay with the person until he/she feels fully recovered.  ~
If the person has a known medical illness or is not fully recovering you should refer the  ~
person to a medical doctor. 
If possible, call a family member to come and fetch the person.  ~
Treatment adherence
If a diagnosis is confirmed, the Medical Officer or specialist may prescribe medicines for the individual. 
The medicines for common mental disorders are ‘antidepressants’ for depression and ‘anxiolytics’ for 
anxiety disorders.
Some key points to be kept in mind regarding these medicines are as follows,
Medicines will help the person to feel better ~
However, medicines will not make the person feel better immediately, they will take 2-4  ~
weeks to work
Medicines need to be taken daily as prescribed ~
These must not be stopped when feeling better but taken as long as the doctor suggests ~
These may cause side-effects such as tiredness, dry mouth, constipation or weight gain (e.g.:  ~
‘amitriptyline’) or nausea or sleeping problems (e.g. ‘fluoxetine’)These medicines will not make the person dependent.
 ~
As an ASHA, you will have a key role in ensuring treatment adherence. Following advice is to be 
given to person taking medicines–
Take your tablets daily in the dosage as prescribed. 9
Never stop your medicines without consulting CHO or PHC-MO 9
Continuing medication even when you feel better will prevent further relapses. 9
Side effects may occur in the beginning, they usually disappear after 1-2 weeks, be patient. 9
Medicines will take a while to make you feel better, wait for 4 weeks, be patient. 9
If side effects are very uncomfortable or persistent go to see the doctor. 9
If you don’t feel better after 4 weeks go to see the doctor. 9"

Common Mental Disorders: Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety are often combined 
People with Common Mental Disorders may also drink too much alcohol (ask for it!) 
People with Common Mental Disorders may have a risk of committing suicide! 
Treatment options are available for CMDs, including counselling and medicines 
2. Severe Mental Disorders (SMD)
These are also called psychoses. 
It is important to remember that anyone, men and women can get psychosis. More commonly, the 
psychoses begin between age 20-30. Around 1 out of 100 people will get a psychoses. 
Causes of psychoses: why does a person become psychotic?
Genetics may be a risk factor and may make a person vulnerable  ~
to be affected by a psychosis later in life (but it is still much 
more common that a child of a parent with a psychosis will be 
healthy)
Birth complications ~
Social stressors can be a trigger ~
Repeated cannabis use can be a trigger ~
What symptoms does a person with a psychosis have?
Psychosis can present with range of symptoms. Not every person with psychosis will have the listed 
symptoms. The individual may have some of these symptoms–
Hallucinations  ~
Hearing, seeing or sensing things which are not really there. The most common of these  ¡
symptoms is “hearing voices” .
The voices give orders (most common form of hallucinations) ¡
Seeing, smelling or tasting things that are not there, strange, body sensations ¡
Delusions: having beliefs unrelated to reality and held with firm conviction. Examples– ~
The person may fear that he/she will be harmed e.g. the person may be afraid that  ¡
someone wants to poison him/herThe person may feel that people (including strangers) are laughing at him/her and 
 ¡
talking about him/her or that the television is directing special messages to him/herThe person may also be convinced that he/she is chosen to do great things like healing 
 ¡
people, saving the world or spread religion
Laughing at something sad ~
Not showing emotions at all ~
The person may be fearful, irritable or aggressive (e.g. out of the belief someone is going to  ~
harm him/her)

Poor concentration e.g. They cannot follow a conversation or read a book and remember  ¡
the details as before and /or lack of motivation to do things
Social withdrawal ¡
Poor personal hygiene ¡
Loss of former social skills ¡
Lack of insight  ~
The person has lack of awareness and denial that he/she may be having an illness and  ¡
can show strange behavioursThe person may say things which doesn’t make sense to others e.g. Speech may become 
 ¡
jumbled or hard to understand as the person may jump from topic to topic in a haphazard 
manner
The person may talk to himself/herself ¡
The person may dress in a strange way e.g. wearing very warm clothes in summer ¡
Some key facts about psychoses–
Psychosis can be short or long lasting  ~
A psychosis may be transient if the person is on drugs (e.g. for a religious or traditional  ~
ceremony) or has experienced extreme social stressors (e.g. illness or death of a loved one, 
being alone in a new life situation)
A person may also experience a transient form of psychosis after an accident or a severe  ~
infection (especially an old person)If symptoms of a psychosis stay longer than a month and have adverse effects on the person’s 
 ~
life or family a serious psychosis called “schizophrenia” is probably the causeSchizophrenia always needs treatment with medicines. 
 ~
CASE  3:
Raja is a 35 year old man who is still living with his parents. In his village Raja is known as “the crazy man” . 
When going out he is neglectful of his appearance and hygiene and shows strange behaviors such as talking to himself or suddenly shouting at people. But most of the time Raja would spend at home sleeping late and watching TV. His father complains about Raja being lazy and not helping in the field. Some years ago a doctor had prescribed Raja medicines for hearing voices. But when Raja felt better he stopped the medicines. Two days ago Raja broke the TV set as he thought the people in the TV program are influencing his thoughts.
What are the symptoms presented by Raja?
Raja is taking poor care of his appearance (lack of motivation) ¡
Raja is talking to himself and shouting at people (he is probably hearing voices) ¡
Raja is sleeping late (lack of motivation) ¡
Raja destroyed the TV (he might have felt influenced by the TV, a typical form of delusion) ¡
Raja has stopped medicines (he has no insight in his illness). ¡
The lack of motivation Raja is experiencing is typical for people with a long-lasting untreated  ¡
psychosis."

Similar to Common Mental Disorders, treatment for Severe Mental Disorders also includes 
psychological first aid, counselling, psychotherapy and medicines. 
As an ASHA, if you recognize any individual in your community with such symptoms, your first step 
would be to inform the nearest facility with a Medical Officer and arrange for referral.  However, there would be cases where you would need to provide help to the individual and family before they receive medical care. 
You can provide Mental Health First Aid to the individuals–
Listen without judgement 1. 
Listen with patience, respect and don’t judge
 ¡
If the person doesn’t start talking by him/herself encourage the person to tell you about  ¡
what he/she is doing during every day. 
You may ask the person about any suspicions or fears ¡
Speak with a calm and friendly voice in short and clear sentences ¡
Don’t argue with the person about their hallucinations or delusions (accept that these  ¡
irrational perceptions are real for them, but don’t pretend that they are real for you 
too)
Avoid confrontation to prevent unpredictable actions ¡
Assess risk of suicide and harm to others 2. 
Assess the risk of suicide
Suicide is common; around 1 out of 10 people with psychosis commits suicide! ¡
Ask for suicidal thoughts and if yes, for concrete plans ¡
Ask if the person is hearing voices commanding the person to harm him/herself (if yes,  ¡
ask for advice from your supervisor or a mental health specialist)
Take actions according to what you learnt in chapter 3 about mental health first aid.  ¡
Assess the risk of harm to others
It is NOT common that a person with a psychosis harms others ¡
It can happen in rare cases that a person with a psychosis involves another person in his/ ¡
her delusions and feels threatenedAsk if the person is hearing voices commanding to harm another person (if yes, ask for 
 ¡
advice from your supervisor or a mental health specialist)If a person is threatening violence, call for help

The individual will be assessed by Medical Officer and specialist, who will prescribe medicines for 
her/him.
Medicines for psychoses
When an individual is diagnosed for psychosis by a specialist, medicines are prescribed to him/her. These are called ‘antipsychotics’. 
These medicines are very effective to treat hallucinations and delusions within a few days
 ~
Within the first days the person may feel sedated (tired) from the medicines ~
Medicines usually have to be taken on a daily base, some may also be given as injections  ~
(e.g. one injection every 2 or 4 weeks)
Some of the medicines may cause side-effects like trembling of stiffness of the body (e.g.  ~
Haloperidol) or weight gain (e.g. olanzapine)"
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),27,"Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  27If side-effects are intolerable the doctor will change the medicine or prescribe another  ~
medicine to reduce the side-effects.
Medicines should be taken on a long-term base to prevent further relapses (psychosis  ~
usually occurs in episodes)
Once treatment is initiated, you have a key role in ensuring adherence and supporting the individual 
along with help from MPW and CHO. 
How to facilitate treatment adherence
Make sure that the person is taking his/her medicine daily or gets his/her injection  ~
regularly
Advise patients to never stop their medicines without talking to the doctor ~
If intolerable side-effects occur, refer to the doctor ~
Ensure that the patient goes to see the doctor for medical check-ups (e.g. blood tests)  ~
regularly (e.g. once every 3 months)
How to support the person with the psychosis
Once the person is again in touch with reality you may focus on encouraging self-help-  ~
treatments and explain the symptoms of a psychosisEncourage small activities but don’t over burden the person!
 ~
Be aware that once the hallucinations and delusions fade off the person may suffer from a  ~
lack of motivation and a sad mood for a while (always ask for suicidal thoughts during that 
period!)
A worsening of the sleep may indicate a relapse, refer to the doctor ~
Try to follow-up the person every 2-4 weeks ~
It is important to involve and support the family  ~
3. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Disorders
These are specific to the age group, for example, some children can develop slower than other 
children (Intellectual development disability) or show behaviours causing problems.
What is Intellectual developmental disability?
It is a disability with difficulty in both intellectual functioning and in day to day behaviour, which covers many everyday 
social and practical skills. This disability starts before the age 
of 18.  The children may show following features–

The disability may be caused by–
In most cases the cause remains unclear  ~
Problems before the child is born (e.g. poor nutrition for the mother, infections)  ~
Problems during childbirth (early labour, birth complications leading to a lack of oxygen for  ~
the baby e.g.: when the baby has the umbilical cord around the neck) 
Problems in early childhood (poor nutrition, emotional neglect, brain infections, uncontrolled  ~
seizures) Genetic conditions (e.g. Down’s syndrome) 
 ~
Remember– What does not cause developmental disabilities (False beliefs):
The mother’s fault ~
Evil eye or bad spirits ~
Sins of the family ~
Bad behaviours ~
How to identify a child with intellectual development disability? The child will show following 
signs–

4. Neurological conditions
These affect our brains and include epilepsy and dementia. When a person has several seizures, we 
call this Epilepsy. Old people may develop dementia, which means loss of memory. E.g. they may 
forget the names of their family members and not find their house anymore. 
1) Epilepsy
What is epilepsy?
Anyone can get epilepsy ~
Epilepsy usually starts before the age of 20 ~
Around 1 out of 100-200 people will have epilepsy ~
Epilepsy affects both men and women ~

Brain infections (e.g. malaria, meningitis) ~
Brain tumours ~
Alcohol withdrawal  ~
Other serious medical illnesses ~
A hysterical reaction may also look like a seizure, but the person will never lose consciousness. When 
a person older than 30 is having his/her first fit, this might be due to medical causes. Refer such 
person urgently to a nearest medical facility with Medical Officer. 
Myths and Facts about Epilepsy

Use of Community Based Assessment Checklist (CBAC)
You have administered CBAC form to individuals aged 30 years and above. In the CBAC form, there 
is one question regarding “History of fits” . If a man/woman has said yes to this question, then you 
will refer the person to nearest facility, where Medical Officer is available. If the person is taking medications, then you will have role in ensuring treatment adherence and provide information regarding the condition.

2) Dementia
Usually only elderly people (over 60 years) are affected by dementia. Both men and women can 
get dementia. A severely alcohol dependent person may get dementia at an earlier age. Dementia 
occurs in different stages from mild-to-severe. "
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),33,"Types of mental health disorders– How to recognize and help?  |  33Symptoms of dementia
Memory problems: the person may forget things more than usual, in more severe cases the  ~
person may even forget who his/her closest relatives are
Orientation problems: the person may not find his/her room or house anymore and may not  ~
know the time of day
Disturbed behaviors: the person may be restless and walking around at night, show  ~
aggressive behaviors or commit senseless actions (e.g. putting food under the bed), the 
speech may become disturbed
Loss of daily living skills: in more severe cases the person will lose his/her ability to care for  ~
him/herself and will need help for dressing, eating, bathing and toileting
Complete helplessness: in final stages the person may be completely bedridden and in need  ~
of constant care
Causes of dementia
Normal aging processes (mild cases) ~
Insufficient blood circulation in the brain (due to smaller strokes in the brain) ~
Alzheimer’s disease (destruction of brain tissue) ~
AIDS may also cause dementia ~
How does dementia affect the family?
The elderly are treated with love and respect in most families and when an elderly person  ~
starts to behave in a disturbed manner it will put a lot of stress on the familyWhen dementia gets worse the person will need someone (usually a family member) caring 
 ~
for him/her.
There may be few individuals in your community who are suffering from such symptoms. Your role 
would be to recognize the symptoms and provide appropriate help. 
How to recognize a person with dementia?
In the CBAC form, you will be asking four specific questions to the elderly (those 60 years and above). 
Out of these four questions, two questions will provide you information regarding dementia. 
Forgetting names of your near ones or your own home address ~
Needing help from others to perform everyday activities such as eating, getting dressed,  ~
grooming, bathing, walking, or using the toilet.
If any individual responds Yes to any of the above or both the questions, you will refer the individual to nearest Medical Officer. 
How to help a person with dementia
If the person exhibits any of the symptoms of dementia, refer him/her to the nearest health facility 
with Medical Officer. Some symptoms of dementia can be treated with medicines. You can provide first aid to the individual.

may cause harm to himself due to his helplessness (e.g. running away from home)
A person with mild dementia may have symptoms of a common mental disorder ~
How to help family living with a person with dementia
As we learnt, dementia is common in elderly persons. The family having elderly persons may also 
need your support for this. They also need someone to talk to and assure them. As ASHA you may be able to help them through providing psychosocial support. 
What can you help family members?
Educate them about dementia, disturbed behaviours and aggressive behaviours. Assure 
 ~
them that they will be able to handle this. 
Family members should understand that person with dementia needs to be cared with  ~
patience and compassion. It is common for the person to forget that they have eaten or taken a bath. Asking repeatedly 
 ~
for such things may cause irritation. A lot of patience is required for such cases. Family members can be suggested to take turns to take care of the elderly as it could be 
 ~
often exhausting for one person to take care of the elderly constantly.Inform them about need of continued care and accompaniment in case the dementia 
 ~
progresses.

You as an ASHA would be aware of individuals in your community who may be using excessive 
alcohol. You have also administered CBAC form to individuals 30 years and above, which contains question regarding ‘Use of alcohol’ . However, not everyone using alcohol is suffering 
from Alcohol Use Disorder. You can ask certain questions to understand if the person is drinking 
too much.
How will you recognize someone is drinking too much?
The person may not admit that he/she is drinking too much alcohol
 ~
Ask how much money the person spends on alcohol ~
It is also possible that a family member will approach you and ask you for help ~
A person is drinking secretly / hiding alcohol ~
A person drinks alcohol daily or in the morning ~
Social, physical or mental problems occur ~
You will refer the individual to MPW/CHO, if you suspect Alcohol Use Disorder. MPW or CHO can 
ask detailed questions (using AUDIT tool) and provide help to that individual. "

Vishal is a 43 year old man who is coming to the primary health clinic with a number of physical complaints. 
He reports that he is not sleeping well and feels like vomiting in the morning with burning stomach pains. He has been to a doctor who prescribed him pills for the stomach pain and nausea which didn’t help much. 
Today he is also trembling and sweating and ‘begging’ the ANM to give him some sleeping pills. The ANM 
suspects that he might be suffering from an alcohol use disorder. Being asked about how much alcohol he drank in the last two weeks he admits that he has been drinking about 4-6 beers daily and sometimes in-between shots of self-brewed spirits. Now he is desperate as he has run out of money.

2) Use of tobacco and other substances
Tobacco is available in smoking form, mostly as beedis and cigarettes in India. It is also available in 
smokeless form as paan masala, gutka, snuff. You have learnt in detail about tobacco and its effects 
during your training on non-communicable diseases. 
Other substances include cannabis products like bhang, ganja (grass/pot/weed), charas/hashish, 
marijuana. There are certain substances which are injected or inhaled. 
How can you identify individuals suffering from alcohol/ tobacco/cannabis/opioid/inhalant use 
disorders?
Some individuals use the substance occasionally – but do not lose control over the amount they use. 
However, EVEN such use can cause brain and muscle incoordination, leading to serious problems such as head injuries. Some individuals become dependent which increases the risk of various 
health and social problems. 
IDENTIFYING DEPENDENCE
(at least 3 of the following to be present together in the past year)
Strong desire to use (craving) ¡
Unable to reduce the amount used ¡
Withdrawal symptoms when they don’t use or use less than usual amount (e.g. hands shaking,  ¡
feeling irritable, not able to sleep)
Needing more and more quantities of the substance to get the desired effect ¡
Neglecting responsibilities and spending more time using the substance or with related  ¡
activitiesContinuing to use although aware of the negative effects. ¡

Suicide is the main cause of death among young people in India. Individuals suffering from mental 
health disorders are at more risk of suicide attempts. It is observed that, around 1 out of 10 people 
with a mental health disorder die from suicide. Women have more suicide attempts and men have 
more completed suicides. It is also observed that there would be more individuals (10-20 times more), who would attempt suicide. Therefore, it is crucial to provide appropriate help to these individuals.

What are the roles of other members of Primary Health Care Team at SHC-HWC?
MPW-F/ANM: She will have a role in outreach as well as SHC/SHC-HWC based activities. She will 
support you in completion of CBAC forms either through joint visits or providing clarifications 
regarding the form. If you have recognized any symptoms in an individual, you will inform MPW-F or 
CHO. MPW-F will then administer a more detailed tool called ‘Community Informant Decision Tool’ (CIDT) to understand more about the symptoms. 
Community Health Officer: The key role of CHO is screening of individuals, delivering psychosocial 
interventions, dispensing the medications prescribed by PHC-MO or specialist, and monitoring for 
side effects and toxicity, referral of cases as appropriate and providing follow up care in coordination 
with you (ASHAs) and MPWs. CHO will also provide emergency care for person experiencing seizure and refer after stabilization.
PHC: CHO at SHC-HWC will refer the suspected individuals to Medical Officer at PHC for diagnosis. 
PHC-MO will confirm the diagnosis of certain conditions like depression, anxiety, epilepsy and dementia. He/she would also provide emergency management for suicide by poisoning and 
seizure. He/she would start the treatment for certain conditions like depression, anxiety, epilepsy 
which can be continued by CHO at SHC-HWCs as per instructions of MO. For certain conditions like psychoses, suicidal behaviour, sever depression, MO will refer the individual to higher facilities, for 
confirmation.

particular day. You can also undertake health promotion during home visits and community 
meetings, including meetings of the VHSNC/MAS.
With the help of MPWs and CHO, you can plan for certain activities for mental health promotion. 
These can include,

2.  Use of Community Based Risk Assessment Checklist (CBAC)
You have been undertaking population enumeration and updating the list of individuals annually. 
As you know, Community Based Risk Assessment (CBAC) is administered to individuals of age 30 
years and above. You will continue the same activity of completion of CBAC through home visits. 
The CBAC tool will have questions which will inform you about dementia among elderly, history of fits, use of alcohol and depression. 
(1) Alcohol use –
In part A of CBAC, you will ask question about history of alcohol use daily and will record Yes or 
No to give a score. 
In part B of CBAC, you will ask questions for early detection of any condition. 
(2) Epilepsy –
You will record if the individual has ‘History of fits’ .
(3) Dementia –
You will record if the elderly individual (60 years and above) is
Needing help from others to perform everyday activities such as eating, getting dressed, 
 ¡
grooming, bathing, walking, or using the toilet
Forgetting names of your near ones or your own home address ¡
In Part B, if any of the question is answered as ‘Yes’ , you will refer the individual immediately to 
nearest ‘Medical Officer’ . 
(4) Depression –Part D of CBAC contains two questions for assessing the depression status of individual in lst two 
weeks. These questions are called ‘PHQ-2’ . 
PHQ-2
Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been 
bothered by the following problems?Not at allSeveral daysMore than half the daysNearly every day
1. Little interest or pleasure in doing things? 0 +1 +2 +3
2. Feeling down, depressed or hopeless? 0 +1 +2 +3
Total Score
Anyone with total score greater than 3 should be referred to CHO/MO (PHC/UPHC)
The purpose of ‘PHQ-2’ is to screen for symptoms related to depression in the last two weeks (14 
days). After administering the PHQ-2, you will refer the individuals who have scored more than 3 
to SHC-HWC. Community Health Officer (CHO) at SHC-HWC will ask the individuals more detailed 
questions to understand about the symptoms. CHO will ask questions from a detailed tool called "
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),43,"Service delivery framework: Providing mental health care as a team and Key tasks of ASHA  |  43‘PHQ-9’ to these individuals and provide appropriate advice. The individual will be provided help at 
SHC-HWC or can be referred to PHC-MO by CHO. 
You should also be careful not to create a scare in the community about these disease conditions. 
You must explain to the people that the checklist is not for diagnosing anyone of the condition. They 
need to be screened by CHO first, followed by visit to Medical Officer/specialist for confirmation, if 
necessary. 
3. Recognizing the symptoms of Mental health disorders
You have learnt the symptoms of different disorders. This can help you in recognizing the symptoms and providing appropriate information to the individual and family. Recognition of symptoms is a 
first step and referral to the CHO or MO can guide for early detection of disorder, if any. It is critical 
to understand that presence of symptoms does not provide us with complete information and will require detailed assessment to confirm a disorder. Therefore, even if a individual presents with symptoms, he/she should not be labelled with disorder. 
You may come across the individual presenting with such symptoms, during your home visits 
for providing other services (HBNC, HBYC, other surveys, follow up visit for NCDs etc.) or through 
interaction with community members. 
4. Providing Mental Health First Aid
As an ASHA, you are in a unique position to provide help to individuals experiencing any kind 
of symptoms of mental health disorder. If you recognize such symptoms in any individual, your 
first step would be to encourage the individual for accessing medical care at nearest healthcare 
facility. You have an important role in providing assistance and helping the individuals to seek appropriate help. At the same time, you will need to provide basic care till called ‘Mental Health First Aid’ before such medical care is available. You have learnt in detail about the steps in chapter 
3 and chapter 4. 
Essential steps in Mental Health First Aid are –
Listen without judgement ¡
Assess risk of suicide and harm to self to others ¡
Give reassurance and information ¡
Encourage the person to get appropriate professional help ¡
Encourage self-help treatments, follow up and treatment compliance ¡
5.  Providing advice and support to the family of individual with mental health 
disorder
Families of individuals with mental health disorders are also under stress similar to families of 
individuals with any long-term illness. Moreover, limited information and stigma against the disorder 
can increase the stress. Therefore, family members also require support. They need to be provided 
with right information regarding the disorder and care options to help the individual. 
Family members can also play a key role in helping the individual to get better. As an ASHA, you 
would provide support to the family members and provide them with right information about disorder, available care options. "
MNS care Training manual for ASHA at HWC (english),44,"44  |  Training Manual on Mental, Neurological and Substance Use (MNS) Disorders Care for ASHA Community based assessment checklist (CBAC)  |  45You have learnt about the ways to help and involve family in the chapter on Mental Health First Aid. 
You can undertake this activity through home visits. 
6. Undertaking home visits for ensuring treatment compliance 
Most of the mental health disorders would require a long-term medication. If not medication, they would need continuing support to maintain mental health. You will play a key role in ensuring 
treatment adherence. As per the guidance of CHO, you will visit the individual to ensure if the 
prescribed treatment is being followed. The frequency of visit will vary depending upon the condition. MPW/ASHA facilitator and CHO may accompany you and help you during some visits. "

ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,1,"Societies that are patriarchal (controlled by men) consider women to be inferior to men. 
Patriarchy is based on unequal power relations where men control each aspect of women’s 
lives. Consequently women in such societies, have less access to and control over resources and have minimal or no say at all in decision-making in the family as compared to men. This leads to domination over and discrimination against women by men and are reinforced time and time again as part of social norms and cultural ethos. This prevents full advancement of 
women.
The cycle of disparity starts even before birth where males are valued over females and 
therefore we see sex selective elimination of female foetus. These disparities and unequal social status are the  root cause of Violence against Women.
Violence against Women is a serious problem affecting women in India and worldwide. 
It is rooted in social structures and is prevalent in all classes of society. It affects women cutting across age groups, cultures, religions, socio- economic strata and educational and 
geographical backgrounds. While it is commonly believed that it is men who inflict violence 
on women, this is not always true. Often women face abuse and harrasement by female members of their household. Most violence takes place in the confines of the home or neighbourhood.IntroduCtIon"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,2,"2 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN1. VIolenCe – Forms and ContrIbutIng F aCtors 
Violence against women can be:
Physical Violence Slapping, fractures, cuts, bites, pulling hair, beating, punching, 
kicking or causing injuries with or without weapon, acid attacks,  
strangling  and pregnancy complications due to abuse.
Sexual Violence Sexual assaults like rape or attempt to rape, forced sexual encounters, 
eve teasing, molestation, stalking, sexual trafficking, forced and/
or child marriage, sexual harassment at workplace, denying use of 
contraceptives, sexual advances from other family members, child sexual abuse, forced and painful sex, withholding sex.
Economic Violence Denial of rights to inherit property and access to money, deprivation from food, clothing, education and health care, not allowing women to work, aggressively demanding expalnations for expenditures, dowry demands, unpaid domestic labour or harassment by those 
who are powerful or in positions of power.
Emotional Violence Neglect, mental trauma, threats to cause harm or kill, isolation, 
verbal abuse, suspicion, denying paternity of the child, insulting 
woman in public or private, and fault finding in every activity etc.
Some acts of violence like physical or sexual abuse are obvious and visible in society while 
acts of emotional and economic violence are often not even perceived as violence. 
In your village and surrounding community, there are instances of violence happening 
every day against women. Violence against women spans across different stages of life starting from as early as before the birth of a girl child and extending till old age. You would have heard of cases of elimination of the foetus (unborn child) because it is a 
female. Sex and gender are complex determinants of gender violence. “Sex refers to the biological 
and physiological characteristics of men and women. “Gender”  refers to roles, behaviours, 
activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women. 
Some examples of sex characteristics are: 
Women menstruate while men do not
Women have breasts that are usually capable of lactating while men have not"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,3,"Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 3 Neglect of the girl child is common and is visible in 
various forms such as- depriving them of breast milk, 
giving them less food than their brothers or feeding 
them after the boys in the family, not taking them to hospitals in case of illnesses, not allowing them to go to school and getting young girls married before they 
attain the legal age for marriage i.e, 1 8 years etc. 
You would have also seen women being teased, 
molested or heard of sexual assaults on women and 
,acid attacks on women. Sexual violence can also 
happen to children (girls and boys) from newborn through adolescence.
Other instances of violence include harassment for dowry, crimes committed to preserve the honour of a family or clan or community (killing 
or sexually assaulting the young couple if they 
chose to marry against societal/family norms), women facing intimidation and harassment at the 
workplace, or in schools or in public places. 
It is not only girls and young women who face 
violence. Older women are also often victims of violence, and are often neglected, not provided 
with health care or nutritious food or are made to do menial work or are even abandoned. 
Domestic Violence is one of the most common forms of 
violence against women. It is inflicted by the husband or 
other close family members. Domestic violence includes all the above mentioned categories of violence i.e, 
physical, emotional, economic and sexual. Any sexual 
assault including rape committed by the husband or any other family member should also be considered as sexual violence against the woman. This type of violence is 
frequently invisible since it happens behind closed doors 
and often the community does not treat it as a type of violence but considers it as a “private family matter”, and accepts it as a normal part of life. 
Often women who are abused are reluctant to seek help because of feelings of shame and 
guilt, fear of being blamed, no economic independence, no confidence that the organizations 
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,4,"4 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN(Police, doctors) can help them , (as a result of negative experiences), fear of consequences, 
protecting the family’s reputation, or thinking it won’ t happen again. One big reason women 
endure violence is that there are no alternatives. Raising her voice often leads to the woman 
being thrown out of her marital family and she is often not supported by her natal family. This fear often prevents women from speaking out. A woman living alone, or with her natal family is also not accepted in the society. 
Violence against women leads to various physical, mental and social consequences. It results 
in women being denied their rights and entitlements, makes for low representation in public/ 
political spaces, denial in positions, of decision making and even restricts their access to 
schools, health facilities and employment. 
As an ASHA you are close to the women of your community and already share a rapport 
with them, which makes it easier for you to identify who is at risk or who is facing such forms of violence. This handbook will help you learn how to identify, intervene and address issues 
of violence against women in your community.
This handbook deals with only violence against women, but this does not mean that there is 
no violence against men. In fact older men often face the same forms of violence that older 
women face. The forms, manifestations and consequences are different for men and are not 
included in this handbook."

ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,6,"6 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMENThe table below lists various factors with examples that underline the violence against 
women
Factors Examples
Culturally defined roles for men and 
women and societal acceptance of these roles and associated behavioural norms 
 Boys/ Men should be tough, and aggressive 
while girls/women should be docile and 
passive 
 Women’s activities should be restricted to 
cooking, household work, and looking after 
husband and children 
 Girls and women should dress appropriately, 
and it is their fault if men are provoked into 
sexual violence. 
Expectations of roles and power 
differentials within relationshipsA man can do whatever he wants, and treat his wife in any way, but a wife should always listen to her husband.
Superstitions regarding witchcraft 
and irrational practices Women who suffer from acute mental trauma are classified as being “witches”, and often made 
to go through cruel rituals, or the practice of ostracizing women form the community
Belief that men are born superior and are wiserMen are brought up to think  that they have a ‘right’ to certain things— to a ‘good’ wife, to sons, to and for making all the decisions in the 
family—just because they are men. Underlying 
factors can be about control of property and getting rid 
Values that give men exclusive rights over womenMen think of women and girls as their Property: something they own—they are more likely to feel as though it is their right to treat them however 
they want.
Notion of the family as the private 
sphere and under male controlMany people believe it is not their business to intervene in cases of domestic violence. It’s not right to interfere with the private affairs of a couple or a household. However, the truth is that non-intervention in a case of known domestic 
violence is a crime."
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,7,"Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 7 Factors Examples
Customs of marriage (bride price/
dowry)Woman is harassed by her husband and his family members if she does not satisfy their demand for dowry
Acceptability of violence as a means to resolve conflictConflicts between families or communities result in violence against women as a method of revenge
Women often are unemployed or have little or no access to economic resources.
Limited access to cash and credit leads to 
economic dependence of women on men 
 A woman continues to stay with an abusive 
husband if she has no access to money, and no 
safe haven to go
 The lack of financial resources and consequent 
dependency on the husband or family for 
money, prevents women from voicing the 
abuse that they are facing, much less taking 
action. 
Discriminatory traditional rules/
practices in the family that violate 
women’s rightsThough recognized by law, many families do not 
give inheritance share and property rights to 
daughters
Low awareness on laws related to women’s rightsLack of awareness about laws that ensure action against violence such as dowry, PCPNDT, sexual harassment, rape in marriages, domestic violence, financial maintenance after divorce, child custody, prevent many women from breaking silence against the acts of violence. Important stakeholders such as police still consider domestic 
violence a private matter.
Insensitive treatment of women and 
girls by police and legal systemsPolice do not register the complaint of a woman especially if she has been abused by a powerful member of the community. 
 Cases of domestic violence are not taken 

seriously and it is the woman who is always 
blamed  
 Sometimes police harass women who register 
complaints. 
Delayed Justice Cases pending in court for years, time consuming 
legal procedures, low conviction rates lead to lack of confidence in women to report or access legal aid, 
leading to women staying in violent situations.what is the reason that she 
does not leave her abusive 
husband?? "
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,8,"8 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMENIt is important to be conscious of the fact that all women are vulnerable to violence. Violence 
against women is not always visible. You also need to understand that violence can progress 
from verbal to physical abuse. By being alert to certain -signs and symptoms, types of 
behaviour and life situations you can identify women at risk or those who may possibly be suffering from violence.
2.  WhICh Women are Vulnerable to VIolenCe?
You should be aware that while violence can happen to any woman, some women are particularly vulnerable. They are: 
Women living in poverty

Orphaned girls or girls with a single parent
Female headed households where the father or husband, is missing or dead
Women with alcoholic husbands are also more prone to violence.
Destitute women
Old women or those suffering from illness
Women with disability or those having disabled children
Women from marginalized or minority communities
Sex workers
Women identifying as part of a sexual minority for example-lesbian or bisexual
Women residing in state run institutions or shelter homes
 Women in post disaster and conflict situations - Young girls or women are at higher 
risk of sexual exploitation and trafficking in disaster situations (floods, earthquakes, 
cyclone, tsunami etc) and conflict situations (riots, family disputes and war, terrorist and 
insurgency attacks). The vulnerability is higher if they have lost their parents, guardians, 
or other family members.
3. What symptoms and sIgns should alert you?
Violence against women can have physical or mental manifestations or affect the woman’s reproductive health. When describing their symptoms women may not explicitly tell 
you that they have encountered abuse. During your home visit you may notice that 
women may repeatedly complain about the signs mentioned below, especially in the case of sexual violence, but may not share the truth about sexual violence. You will "
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,9,"Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 9 notice that often there is a delay between the time of injury and treatment seeking. You 
should be sensitive to the fact that women suffering from the symptoms and signs listed 
below could actually be suffering from abuse. Be sure to be sensitive while eliciting the 
history. 
 Bruises on the body, especially around eyes and face, hit marks on ears (leading to 
difficulty in hearing), loose or broken teeth 
 Vague complaints persisting over a long time with no obvious physical cause.  
This may include unspecified complains of pains, numbness, or pain in lower 
abdomen.
Unexplained, spontaneous abortion in pregnant women
Attempted suicide or suicidal thoughts
Anxiety, fear, depression, self- destructive behaviour
Sleeping problems
Complaints that should lead you to the suspicion of sexual

Violence against Women can have serious consequences on their physical and mental health. 
These can be classified as:
 P hysical: Injuries ranging from minor cuts to bruises; burns, 
chronic pain, and malnutrition in the girl child. Severe violence 
may cause fractures, leading to disability and sometimes even 
death.
 Psychological or Mental:  The psychological and 
emotional effects of Violence against women are far 
more damaging than the physical ones. They hamper 
a women’s self –esteem, leading to other mental health problems and may lead to women actually committing suicide or attempts to commit suicide. This can also lead 
to depression, anxiety and headaches. Adolescent girls’ 
and adult women’s reproductive health is affected by sexual coercion.
  
Battered women syndrome:  These can be seen in women who are survivors of long 
term abuse.
 Reproductive:  Unwanted pregnancies, and or sexually transmitted diseases are a 
common manifestation. Other effects include injuries to the reproductive tract, trauma 
during pregnancy leading to complications, such as abortions, premature births and 
even maternal deaths. 
 Consequences on children:  Children who see their mother abused can often become 
angry or aggressive or they may become quiet and withdraw to escape notice. Children 
in abusive families often do not eat well, grow and learn 
slowly than other children and may suffer from mental illnesses. This often leads to unexplained absenteeism or drop out from school and affects their performance. Such 
children may often run away from their homes, engage 
in addition seeking behaviour and develop suicidal tendencies. Also when a woman is abused at home, her children believe that this is the way girls and women are 
to be treated and that violence is acceptable.

Women 
Your role in addressing violence against women is two fold:
A.  Preventing violence: by increasing awareness and mobilizing community against any 
act of violence against women
B.  Addressing violence: Attending to the individual women who has suffered from violence. 
a. preventing violence - role of asha at the Community level:
1.  Build solidarity: Violence against women is a reflection of deep rooted socio-cultural 
biases, and needs sustained, long term awareness raising and mobilisation of the 
community. It is difficult for you as an individual , acting alone to address the issue of 
violence against women. 
  You need to build partnerships with other community based groups such as Village Health Sanitation and 
Nutrition Committees (VHSNC), Gram Panchayat or 
other village level social support groups working for women such as-Mahila Mandals, women self-help groups, Mahila Swasthya Sanghas or Mahila Panchayats. You can also form a group of ASHAs 
working under the same PHC area to generate 
support for taking action on violence. To enable this you can use the forum of monthly PHC review meetings. During these meetings you will be able to hold discussion on issues of violence with the group of ASHAs and also build solidarity. Sometimes women facing violence need urgent support. You should coordinate with these groups who could help in providing an informal support and shelter for women 
facing violence. These groups can also dialogue on a broader platform to address the key 
problem that has led to violence and resolve other issues of violence at the village level. 
  Ensure discussion on the issue of violence against women with other important stakeholders such as- representatives of Panchayat, women’s groups, local community 
leaders, parents of girl children. Building solidarity with groups that have the participation 
and voice of women at village level meetings will make the issue of violence against women more prominent and visible.
  Violence against women is also common in situations of family rivalries and in religious 
or caste based conflicts. Women are generally viewed as property or posession and 
are often the first ones to be attacked. In these cases you should overcome your own internal barriers of being associated with a particular group and strive hard, making special efforts to reach out to such women.
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,12,"1 2 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN2.  Educate the community and increase awareness: Building awareness and mobilizing 
your community to prevent violence against women should form a part of your core 
activities. You should organize meetings with adolescents and women in your village to 
discuss this issue. You can do this by-
 Dispelling beliefs such as- “beating is a form of expressing love; being abused is 
alright for me; a woman cannot live without 
her partner even if he abuses her; it’s a woman’s fault that she faced rape or a girl a should be married off early as it prevents her from getting sexually abused. 
 Educating adolescent girls and women during 

their monthly meetings on violence issues and 
enabling them to share any experience so that action can be taken.
 Raising awareness on various legal provisions or Acts that prohibit domestic 

violence, sexual harassment etc (Annexure 1)
 Using the VHSNC to organize mobilizational campaigns around dowry related 
abuse, pre-birth elimination of female foetus, girl child infanticide, early childhood 
marriages, registration of marriage, giving inheritance to girls, honour killings, trafficking of girls, and girl child discrimination.
 Disseminating information to the community members on various welfare schemes 

of the government to promote social and economic empowerment of girls and 
women. Some of these include- schemes providing education and financial assistance for girl children, SABLA scheme, Mahila Samakhya, pension for widow, unmarried and destitute women etc. (Your facilitators will provide information on 
specific schemes that have been implemented in your state). 
b. addressing individual cases of violence:
1.  Be alert to the issue: You can find out if a woman is at risk or facing violence by being 
alert and looking for clues that will help you in identifying such women. For example: a husband who displays controlling behaviour, or is unwilling to leave the woman’s side when you are talking to her, should alert you to the possibility of abuse. Look for the presence of injuries that do not match the explanation of how they occurred. 
  If you have identified a woman at risk of violence or being subjected to violence even if she has not reported it, you need to obtain more details regarding the violence. Any action you take should be discussed with the woman, otherwise she will be put at increasing risk. If the woman is not yet ready to speak out, then provide her with emotional support until she is.
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,13,"Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 1 3   You should distinguish between severe forms of violence where the woman is in need of 
urgent interventions, from less severe forms of violence which are no less damaging but 
do not have life threatening consequences. 
What will you do when you are confronted with a severe case of violence: Shift the 
woman to safe place immediately. When you come across violence directly in front 
of you or there is a situation where the violence can be a threat to a woman’s life. Take 
immediate action. You should immediately find a family member or another member of 
the community (whom you trust) to remove the woman from the source of violence. If required you can seek police protection. You can seek shelter for the woman in shelter or 
short stay homes available in the area or contact other NGOs who provide support and 
services to help the woman in distress. 
2.  Ask questions.  Questions should always be asked privately and in a non-judgemental 
manner. Direct questioning on violence may not give you an answer. Build the trust of the woman and reassure her that the information she shares will be kept confidential. Remember that asking questions in front of her family members or partner can put her in danger. 
3.  Enable access to health services: You should assess if 
the woman is suffering from any physical injury or mental 
trauma. Provide first aid for minor injuries but if you 
notice other serious effects refer her to an appropriate health care facility and escort her if necessary and ensure follow up.
4.  Provide emotional support: As an ASHA you can 
become her primary confidante and help by making the woman break silence and share her feelings about the experience of violence. Talk to her and help her overcome the feelings of shame, fear, anger and depression. Reassure 
that abuse is not her fault. 
5.  Take measures for the woman’s safety: Explain to the woman that she should try and 
anticipate situations when violence is likely to occur and seek a safe haven for herself and her children.
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,14,"1 4 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN  In situations where the woman is determined to leave the abusive individual, you 
should with the help of community/VHSNC help her in identifying a safe space like her 
maternal home, a friend or relative’s house where she can be temporarily located until 
the situation is resolved. In some districts, government or NGO run centres are also functioning to support women in distress. You can support the woman in seeking shelter at these centres if support from family and friends is not available  
  When the woman leaves try to make sure that she carries all the important documents such as-identity card, bank pass book, ration card, her and the children’s birth certificate, 
marriage registration or proof, educational certificates, health related records, assets or 
jewellery on her name, etc. 
  It is important to confront the perpetrator of violence so that there is no repetition of such violence episodes and raise awarenss about the legal provisions avialble for women 
under the law. You can do this with the support of ANM, AWW, or other members of 
your community, including the VHSNC and women’s groups and Gram Panchayat
6.  Inform the woman on legal recourse:  You should also 
share information with the woman regarding places 
or persons to contact in case she wants to report the 
violence and seek action for the violence faced. Most districts in the country have a Women’s Police Station. 
She could also contact functionaries of the Women and 
Child Department (AWW, ICDS supervisors, CDPOs). These persons will forward her complaint to the concerned “Protection Officer” of the WCD. This officer 
has been authorized by the government to take action 
on violence against women, and there is a toll free number to reach this officer. You can provide her with details of Legal Aid Centres existing in court at the district level and provide guidance on 
seeking legal assistance. 
7 .  Accessing other resources for assistance: To 
facilitate action on violence you should have the telephone numbers of Police, support organizations and media personnel- such as newspaper/magazine 
reporters, radio and TV journalists. Media is an 
important medium to build social pressure to take action on violence. 
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,15,"Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN | 15 What to do in cases of rape
Take the following additional steps in the case of a 
woman who has been raped:
 Immediately after the sexual assault, the most 
important thing for the victim is to get to a safe 
place. This could be the victim’s home, a friend’s 
home or with a family member
 Be supportive and reassure her that it is not her 
fault. Treat her with kindness and understanding. 
 Find out from her if she could identify the person who raped her,the circumstances 
under which it happened and the extent of her injuries. 
 It is vital for the woman to receive medical attention, and strongly recommended 
for her to receive a forensic examination. You should also accompany the woman to 
the healthcare facility.
 Preserving the evidence (biological material left 
on the victim’s body) is important to identify the 
perpetrator in a sexual assault case, especially 
those in which the offender is a stranger. Thus the 
woman should not bathe or clean up before the 
examination. 
 Support the woman and family members in 
seeking help from police and enable them to 
contact other organizations working in the community to support the woman who 
has been raped. 
 Even if the victim has not yet decided to report the crime, receiving a forensic 
medical exam and keeping the evidence safe will improve the chances that the 
police can access and test the evidence later.
 Give her emergency contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy. Immediate 
hospitalization is needed if injuries are severe. 
 Help the woman tell her family members in case she has not already told. Remember 
that family members also need to overcome their feelings about rape.
 Tell the woman and family members that although the incident is devastating, one 
must try and move on, and that this incident is not the end of everything. 
 The woman may need special psychological counselling and should be supported 
for referral to a district hospital. 
"
ASHA Handbook - Mobilizing for Action on Violence against Women English,16,"16 | Mobilizing for Action on VIOLENCE A GAINST W OMEN6. hoW to keep yourselF saFe 
Like any other woman you can also be 
subjected to violence within your home 
or outside. It is possible that you go on 
tolerating violence and are not able to overcome your apprehension sufficiently. The situation is compounded by the fact 
that even though you are empowered 
to take action for violence against other women, you may be hesitant to acknowledge to yourself or to others that 
you are being abused. Remember that you 
should help yourself before you begin to help others. Being able to articulate your 
own problems will instil empathy and help 
you to support other women better, given your own experience. 
Remember that violence against women is a manifestation of power. It is often individuals 
in positions of power who engage in inflicting abuse on women. There is a chance 
that because of your involvement in mobilizing against the issue and helping women 
who encounter violence, may make you vulnerable to harassment and even abuse by dominant, powerful individuals in the community. You should always be conscious of this and actively seek the support of other individuals such as the elders in your village 
and members of the VHSNC. Make sure that it is well known in the community that you 
have linkages and connections amongst respected elders, police and the health care system. Also practise safety measures such as avoiding walking alone, staying away from isolated places, moving in groups after dark, etc.

Listed below are some situation which may be familiar to you. After reading each situation identify what actions you can take. Some of these require immediate intervention, and some 
will need repeated visits and counselling, and some will need you to work in partnership 
with other groups defined earlier. Also identify which of these can be remedied by action at the village level and which requires education and awareness building and which needs referral for higher levels.

 1. Importance of Oral Health
 2. Parts of a Healthy Mouth
 3. Who can get Oral diseases?3. INTRODUCTION TO A HEALTHY MOUTH
Oral and dental problems are commonly seen among people.  You may have come across individuals 
who complain of toothache or pain in their gums. Diseases of the oral cavity are seen among children, 
infants, adults and old people. 
Oral health focuses on keeping the oral cavity healthy. This includes the teeth, tongue, inner surfaces 
of cheeks and lips, roof of mouth and floor of mouth.  
Fortunately, most of these diseases are easily preventable if one adopts good oral hygiene practices
 -  Oral infections can lead to heart problems
 -  Inability to eat properly

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresPARTS OF THE HEAL THY MOUTH 
Teeth –  Humans have two sets of teeth: (i) Milk teeth/baby teeth/primary teeth, which erupt during 
the first two years of life and shed between 6-12 years of age, and (ii) Adult teeth/permanent teeth, 
which start erupting at 6-7 years of age and remain lifelong. There are four types of teeth in humans: 
(i) Total 8 incisors or front teeth, (ii) Total 4 canines or conical teeth, (iii) Total 8 premolars and (iv) 
Total 12 molars. All teeth have an outer surface towards the cheek and lips, inner surface towards the 
tongue and the biting/chewing surface.
Figure 2 Cross Section of a Healthy tooth
Tongue  – The tongue has four surfaces: upper, lower and two side surfaces.
Palate  – The roof of the mouth is called the palate, which is formed by hard palate towards the front 
and soft palate behind.
Lips and cheek  – These consist of the surfaces of the cheek and lips inside the oral cavity.
Gums – It is the layer which covers the teeth and attach them to the jaw bone. Healthy gums are 
pink in colour.
Floor of mouth – It is the layer of the oral cavity below the tongue on which the tongue rests."

WHO CAN GET ORAL DISEASES?
It is important to note that oral related diseases can be seen in infants, children, adolescents and 
adults as well. Therefore you need to ensure that everyone in the community from a newborn baby 
to the elderly maintain good oral health.  
Infants:
Breastfeeding is important for growing healthy teeth and strengthening gums of the baby. It is 
essential to initiate breastfeeding within an hour after birth, practice exclusive breastfeeding for the 
first six months of life and continue breastfeeding till two years of age.   If a baby is bottle fed, they 
can develop gum diseases. "
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,11,"11
11
Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresChildren:
At this age, children are very vulnerable to getting tooth decay. This happens because of poor oral 
hygiene and improper tooth brushing. Also increase in intake of sweets and junk food can lead to 
cavities in the teeth. In small children (0-6 years old) sometimes, certain cavities affect upper front 
teeth and are common mainly in those who are fed bottled milk. 
Adolescents and adults:
This is the age when people develop the habit of chewing tobacco or smoking.  Tobacco consumption 
can affect the Oral health in several ways and is leading cause of Oral cancers. Also, poor oral hygiene 
and improper tooth brushing can cause several oral health problems. Women tend to ignore 
symptoms till it is  late after which they have complications. 
Elderly:
The main problem in elderly is missing teeth. Maintaining oral hygiene and use of properly fitting 
dentures can prevent teeth and gum diseases in the elderly. Many old people also chew tobacco or 
smoke. They can be prone to oral cancers. "

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres4. ORAL HEALTH PROMOTION 
As you have learnt in other modules, health promotion focuses on 
 y Keeping people healthy
 y Helping people make changes in lifestyle to prevent diseases
 y Motivating behaviour changes to avoid complications among those with diseases
Similarly, prevention and control of health problems also involves these principles. The three main 
ways in which you can help prevent oral diseases among people in the community are:
A. Oral health promotion – Prevent oral diseases from occurring in individuals by helping them 
adopt healthy lifestyle practices such as proper tooth brushing. 
B. Diagnosis and treatment – Early detection of oral diseases in individuals and help them get 
prompt treatment so that the disease is controlled at an early stage, especially in oral cancers.
C. Prevent complications of the disease and its progression to late stages in the individual by 
facilitating complete treatment and follow ups.
ADOPTION OF HEAL THY PRACTICES
Oral health promotion focuses on 
 y Teaching proper tooth brushing techniques
 y Explaining how to adopt healthy lifestyle to prevent oral diseases
 y Creating awareness among people regarding common oral diseases
 y Getting people to go for regular annual oral health check-up after the age of 30 years. 
How to maintain a Healthy Mouth
1. Good oral hygiene
a. Brushing teeth
 y Brush teeth at least twice a day (after waking up in the morning and before going to sleep at 
night). Brushing teeth before going to sleep is more important since it removes all food particles 
which provides suitable environment for the germs to create mouth problems like bad breath, 
tooth decay etc. 
 y The correct technique of brushing teeth is shown in the diagram below. It should be followed 
to make brushing effective. In this chapter, you will learn:
 1. What is oral health promotion?
 2.   How to maintain a good oral hygiene?
 3.  Risk factors and Prevention of Oral Diseases "
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,13,"13
13
Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres y Teeth should be brushed for at least two minutes every time with a soft toothbrush and pea-
sized amount of toothpaste. 
 y Ideally, toothbrush should be changed every three months or when the bristles start to flare. 
In addition, toothbrush should be discarded in case the person suffers from any respiratory 
infection and a new toothbrush should be used after recovering from the illness.
Figure 4 Brushing Technique
b. Cleaning tongue
 y The tongue should be cleaned using the toothbrush or a tongue cleaner every time along with 
brushing teeth.
 y The technique of cleaning tongue is shown in the picture below.

"
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,14,"14

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centresc. Rinsing of mouth after every meal
 y The mouth should be rinsed with water after every 
meal. This helps remove any food particle stuck to 
the teeth which can cause tooth decay. 
 y If possible swish water in mouth for 2 minutes or at 
least 60 seconds
2. Eating right
 y Eating too much of sweet and sticky foods like chocolate, toffee, chips, cold drinks, gajjak, rewdi 
can lead to tooth decay. After eating these items, the mouth should be rinsed properly with 
water. Snacking between meals should be avoided. A healthy diet is essential to maintain healthy 
teeth and gums. A well-balanced diet should be taken including grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts 
and dairy products.
Figure 7 Consume Balanced diet Figure 8 Avoid food causing caries
3. Avoiding tobacco use
 y The use of tobacco in any form (smoke 
or chewable) causes stains on teeth and 
increases the risk of gum disease. Tobacco 
consumption can also cause burning 
sensation in mouth while eating, reduced 
mouth opening, white patches in mouth 
and oral cancer. Every person who uses 
tobacco should be motivated to stop and 
those who have not yet started should be 
counselled not to start. Stress often leads 
to increased consumption of tobacco and 
alcohol. Stress management techniques like 
yoga and meditation should be practised.

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres4. Regular dental check-ups
 y Healthy mouth is required for eating 
balanced diet, speech clarity, socialising with 
people which are also needed for a healthy 
life. Therefore, Oral health check-up should 
be done routinely to detect oral diseases in 
an early stage which will aid in prevention 
and easy management of oral diseases. It is 
important to get regular dental/oral check-
ups to assess oral health status by a qualified 
Dental Specialist /Dentist. It is recommended 
that Oral check-up should be done every six 
months to one year.
5. Oral self-examination
 y Self-examination of the oral cavity is very important. It is essential to raise awareness about oral 
self-examination technique as well as common oral lesions to look out for and seek treatment in 
case they are seen. The technique of oral self-examination is shown in the picture below. 
a) First check the lips, and the inside lining of the lips
b) The next place is to check the inside of the cheeks on both sides
c) Thirdly, check on the palate the hard and soft part on the roof of the mouth
d) Then check the tongue. If you have a piece of guaze or a clean cloth, you can hold the 
tongue with that and look in the mirror
e) Then look under the tongue 
f) Finally check both sides of the tongue. 
You can advise people to do this examination once a month. If they  find anything abnormal then 
they can  inform you or visit the nearest Health facility for check-up

RISK FACTORS  AND PREVENTION OF   ORAL DISEASES
The risk factors for diseases of the oral cavity are discussed below:
Diet 1. Consumption of aerated 
sweetened beverages 
and high sugary foods 
including a lot of sugar 
and fat, low in fibre and 
essential vitamins can lead 
to dental caries.
2. Vitamin C is required for 
maintaining proper health 
of gums. Vitamin C can be 
obtained from citrus fruits 
and vegetables like Orange, 
Amla, Pineapple etc 
Tobacco 
and Alcohol 
Consumption1. Any form of tobacco 
consumption including 
smoking (cigarettes, 
bidis, pipes, hukka etc) 
and smokeless (chewing 
tobacco, snuff, paan, 
masheri (tobacco applied 
on gums) forms of tobacco 
can increase the risk of 
developing gum diseases 
and oral cancer which can 
also cause deaths.
2. Intake of alcohol in large 
quantities increases the risk 
of general conditions such 
as high blood pressure, 
liver disease, heart disease 
and oral cancer
Poor Oral Hygiene Not brushing teeth and rinsing 
mouth regularly leads to poor 
oral hygiene and can cause 
bad breath, gum diseases, and 
various oral infections
"
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,17,"17
17
Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresTooth Injury Injury to the teeth and jaw can 
cause improper alignment of 
teeth. This may lead to food 
stagnation and can cause tooth 
decay and gum diseases.
Stress Excessive stress can lead to 
health problems and lifestyle 
changes (like, excessive 
smoking, increasing alcohol 
intake, changing dietary habits, 
becoming physically inactive, 
and neglecting oral & personal 
hygiene) which further leads to 
oral health problems
Figure 10 Common Risk factors for Oral Health
Diagnosis of Oral Diseases, Treatment and Prevention of Complications
Every individual should get their oral cavity examined regularly, like regular general health check-
ups. It is recommended to get oral examination done by a doctor every six months. This is required 
in order to diagnose any oral or dental disease at the earliest so that it can be promptly treated 
at the early stage. This also helps in early resolution of the disease and avoids its progression to 
complications. Any case of oral disease should be immediately referred to a dentist. "
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,18,"18

Causes: 
 y Bacteria- Bacteria are very small organisms, not visible to naked eye. When you eat certain 
foods, the bacteria on your teeth breaks them down and produces acids that have the ability 
to seriously damage the hard tissues of your tooth. The result is the formation of cavities in the 
tooth.
 y Pits, groove and fissures present on chewing surfaces of teeth are difficult to clean. Bacteria tend 
to accumulate on it and causes tooth decay5. ROLE OF ASHA IN PREVENTION OF 
COMMON ORAL DISEASES
In this chapter, you will learn:
 1. Different types of common dental problem
 2.  Your role pertaining to each dental problem

MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT ORAL HEALTH
MYTH FAC T:
Oral cavity is the mirror of your body. It is very important to 
maintain good oral health and go for timely dental check-
ups. Poor oral health can lead to serious problems in the 
body
a) Pre term birth or low birth weight of child in pregnant 
women who do not maintain their oral health
b) Research suggests that heart disease, clogged arteries 
and stroke might be linked to the inflammation and 
infections that oral bacteria can cause.
c) Germs from your mouth may travel to damaged parts 
of your heart through the bloodstream leading to a 
disease called endocarditis
Cleft of the lip or palate in a child can occur due to some 
reasons like lack of vitamin C/B in the mother during 
pregnancy, consumption of alcohol/ tobacco products 
during pregnancy, in certain genetic diseases or syndromes 
etc. Management and feeding of a child born with a cleft of 
the lip or palate is possible and these children can also lead 
a normal and active life. Talk to your doctor and dentist 
about this condition
As soon as the first tooth erupts in the mouth, one must 
start brushing the tooth/teeth using a baby tooth brush
Enlarged gums during pregnancy is due to hormonal 
changes in the body and must not be considered as an 
excuse to stop brushing altogether, seek consultation from 
your dentist if the problem persistsOral health has no impact on 
General Health
Cleft is caused because of 
curse or exposure during 
eclipse
Milk teeth should only be 
brushed after all of them 
erupt
Brushing during pregnancy 
can worsen the gum 
bleeding/gum enlargement 
during pregnancy"
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,33,"33

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresMYTH FAC T:
Cavities on teeth should be given immediate attention . 
They can progress to severe problems if left untreated, 
premature loss of deciduous teeth can lead to loss of space 
in the jaw, malaligned teeth etc. on the long run.
Tooth powder /Dantmanjan have abrasives in high 
quantities that can wear off and damage teeth over a 
period of time. Hence, it is recommended to clean your 
teeth using toothbrush and toothpaste everyday.
These substances have abrasives that wear out the 
tooth structure at a fast rate and are not recommended 
to clean your teeth. Gul manjan has nicotine as one of 
its components and can get one addicted to the use of 
tobacco therefore, it must be avoided altogether.
Small microscopic organisms called bacteria can damage 
the tooth structure and lead to cavities when given the apt 
condition to grow. However, these organisms are too small 
to be appreciated without microscopes. Your dentist can 
remove the damaged tooth structure and place a filling to 
prevent deepening of existent cavities or perform a root 
canal treatment if the cavities are too deep .Cavities on milk teeth can 
be left untreated as they 
will shed and new teeth will 
come in their place.
Tooth powder is a better 
alternative to toothbrush 
and toothpaste
Using gul manjan, coal, 
brick powder, ash, charcoal 
powder is beneficial to the 
tooth.
Worms  can be removed from 
teeth  upon noticing decay 
and cavity"
Oral Care Training Manual for ASHA,34,"34

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness CentresMYTH FAC T:
Tobacco should not be considered as a remedy for tooth 
pain, one can start warm saline gargles or take medicines 
as prescribed by a qualified doctor and visit the dentist at 
the earliest to identify the cause of dental pain and seek 
apt dental treatment.
Scaling is done with special instruments to facilitate the 
removal of tartar and calculus only, They do not have 
detrimental effects on the teeth or the gums. Unless 
suggested by your Dentist, scaling is recommended at 
timely intervals to maintain good gum health
Improper technique of tooth removal such as techniques 
practised by quacks can be detrimental to the health of the 
tooth and adjacent structures. Consult a qualifies Dentist 
for tooth extraction if the need arises to avoid such undue 
complications
Fact: The life of your teeth depend on how well you keep 
them. Factors like diet, correct oral hygiene practices, 
regular dental check up are very vital for healthy teeScaling weakens the teeth 
and loosens them, therefore 
tooth-brushing with 
toothpaste is recommended
Tooth extraction can lead to
weakening of eyesight
As you age it is normal
to loose teethKeeping /chewing tobacco
numbs tooth pain"

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
1. Can decay occur early in childhood, what should be done when decay is noticed early in 
childhood? 
 Yes. Continuous bottle feeding of sweetened milk to infants after weaning, particularly at night 
can lead to rampant decay of all teeth, sparing the lower front teeth. Immediately after the first 
tooth erupts, it is important that the mother consults a dentist and gets advised on importance 
of oral hygiene early in life. 
3. What has to be done to avoid staining of teeth? 
 Regular tooth brushing and mouth rinsing habits can help avoid staining on teeth. In case stains 
persist, a dentist has to be consulted. 
4. How often should teeth be cleaned by a dentist? 
 If maintained well, a regular check-up once a year would suffice. Cleaning is essential only when 
plaque deposits harden to form calculus tenaciously attached to the gum. 
5. Can salt / manjan be used for cleaning teeth instead of tooth paste? 
 Gul manjan / manjan / tooth powder or any other such material is found to contain abrasive 
compounds that can lead to wearing off the tooth enamel. Also, it is found that Gul manjan 
contains tobacco and thus can be addictive leading to oral ulcers / cancer. 
6. What can be used to clean teeth? 
 It is advisable to use a soft bristle brush and pea size of tooth paste to clean teeth twice a day. 
This avoids plaque accumulation and prevents decay and gum diseases. 
7. How to keep teeth healthy? 
 Brushing once in the morning and always before sleeping along with a practice of rinsing mouth 
with water after every meal is the best way to keep teeth healthy. Mouth rinsing should also be 
practised after eating sweet / sticky food like cake, bread, biscuits, chocolates, candies, rice etc. 
8. What is the reason for whitish stains on teeth? 
 Presence of whitish stains on teeth following a specific pattern covering multiple upper and 
lower front teeth is indicative of Dental Fluorosis. It occurs due to excessive fluoride in the ground 
water supplies of that region. It needs to be evaluated by a dentist for severity assessment and 
necessary action. Also, if found in excess, the authorities concerned need to be alerted about 
fluoride in water. "

Training Manual on Oral Care for ASHA 
at Ayushman Bharat - Health and Wellness Centres9. What are clefts and why do clefts occur? Can this be treated? 
 A split or opening in the roof of the mouth or the lip is called a cleft. The cause could be genetic 
or certain drugs during early pregnancy or also undernourishment during pregnancy. It is 
important to report to a doctor immediately after birth to understand treatment protocol and 
feeding practices. 
10. What to do when teeth do not begin to erupt even after the age of 1 year? 
 Consult a dentist before any further options are considered. 
11. Can irregularly aligned teeth be corrected, if yes when? 
 Yes. Consult your dentist. Some children need correction of crooked teeth and bite as early as 3 
years while some may need treatment around 12 years. 
12. What is the best way to help a person quit smoking / chewing tobacco? 
 Advising them to delay tobacco use, divert the mind from the thought of tobacco, drink about 
4-5 litres of water a day, do exercise and identify a quit date to completely forgo tobacco is 
something any person can do. In addition, referral to the nearest health facility for personalised 
counselling can help. 
13. How important is it to fill milk teeth? 
 Milk teeth guide the eruption of permanent teeth and act as natural space maintainers for 
the permanent set of teeth. Also, they are important for functional aspects like chewing and 
speaking. It is thus important to keep milk teeth healthy and get decayed milk teeth filled. 
14. Why should a child rinse mouth after using medicated syrups? 
 Most medicated syrups for children are made palatable by adding sweetener. If left uncleaned, 
the retention of syrup on teeth can lead to decay. "

Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,4,"about this book
The sixth and seventh modules cover areas whose content is already 
familiar to the ASHA. In addition, this module includes the development of	specific	competencies	 in	healthcare	 for	mothers	 and	children.	 It	is	thus,	
intended to serve as a refresher module, building on existing knowledge and the development of new skills in the area of maternal and child health. ASHAs that are newly recruited into the programme, could directly start with Module 5, 6 and 7. This module is also designed to serve as a reading material for ASHAs, and is therefore, to be given to each ASHA. A companion communication kit for the ASHA to use when she conducts home visits and village meetings has also been developed. There is also a manual for trainers with training aids to use during the training of ASHA.

 7Child Health & Nutrition
One-third of the world’s undernourished children live in India. About 46% 
of the children below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly one out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under nutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, adolescence and adulthood.
Facts about Malnutrition in Young Children
•	 Malnutrition	increases	susceptibility	to	disease.	Malnutrition	is	one	of	the	
contributory factors to over half of all child deaths.
•	 Malnutrition	is	highly	related	to	poverty.	Poor	families	have	less	money	to	
spend	to	get	the	quantity	and	variety	of	food,	they	find	it	more	difficult	to	get healthcare and also there is less time for child care. 
•	 Counselling	can	help	the	family	in	making	the	right	choices	on	using	
their scarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition. 
•	 Families	are	more	comfortable	when	issues	of	feeding	are	discussed	in	
their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the grandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue. Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: •	 Communicate	essential	messages	for	prevention	of	malnutrition,	advice	on	
feeding and on prevention of illness, and on access to health and nutrition 
services. 
•	 Analyse	the	causes	of	malnutrition	in	a	specific	child	–	the	role	of	feeding	
practices, role of illnesses, of familial and economic factors and of access to services.
•	 Counsel	families	to	prevent	malnutrition	and	to	reverse	malnutrition	in	
children	below	five 	years.1. Infant and Young Child Feeding

8•	 It	is	easier	to	prevent	a	child	from	slipping	into	malnutrition	than	to	
reverse it once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on 
counselling every family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this time, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.
Recognising Malnutrition
It	is	difficult	to	recognise	malnutrition	just	by	looking	at	a	child.	Only	very	severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it	is	too	late.	Most	children	look	normal	but	their	height	and	weight	when	measured is less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child monthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight	the	child	can	be	classified	as	mild,	moderate	or	servely	underweight.
Sick	children	need	special	attention.	However,	families	of	all	children	especially	
children below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent malnutrition.
Six Important Messages for Preventing Child Malnutrition
1. Exclusive Breastfeeding: Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; 
not even water should be added. 
2. Complementary Feeding: At the age of six months, add other foods. 
Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding	for	at	least	one	to	two 	years	more.	There	are	five 	things	to	
remember about complementary feeding:(i)	 Consistency:	Initially	the	food	has	to	be	soft	and	mashed.	But	later,	
anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less spices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. ‘give daal not daal ka pani’.
(ii) Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about 
one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as the mother.
(iii)	Frequency:	The	amount	of	complementary	foods	given	should	be	equal	
to about half what the adult needs in terms of nutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has to be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day . 
(iv) Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in 
energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food .	Family	could	add	a	
spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever edible oil is available in the	house	is	sufficient.
(v)	Variety:	 Add	protective	 foods	–	green	leafy	vegetables.	 The	rule	is	that	the	
greener it is, or the more red it is the more its protective quality. Similarly meat,	eggs,	fish	are	liked	by	children	 and	very	nutritive	 and	protective. 			
3 Feeding during the illness:  Give as much as the child will take; do not 
reduce	the	quantity	of	food.	After	the	illness,	to	catch	up	with	growth,	add	an	extra-feed.	Recurrent	illness	is	a	major	cause	of	malnutrition.	
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,9,"Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 94 Prevent illness:	Recurrent	illness	is	a	major	cause	of	malnutrition.	There	are	
six important things to remember which could prevent illness:
(a) Handwashing:  before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s 
food,	and	after	cleaning	up	the	child	who	has	passed	stools.	This	is	the	single most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea.
(b) Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea. 
(c) Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that cause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are more common and life threatening, than in normal children.
(d) Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and	then	repeated	once	every	six	months	till	five 	years	of	age.	This	too	
reduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in malnourished children.
(e) Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during the illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more rigorous in handwashing and more careful in handling the baby.
(f) Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an	insecticide	 treated	bed	net.	Malaria	too	is	a	major	cause	of	malnutrition. 	
particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea. 
You should encourage parents and other family members to spend time with 
the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the child. Such children eat and absorb food better.
5 Access to health services
u Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. 
On	the	very	first	day	of	the	illness,	if	you 	help	the	mother	decide	
on whether it is a minor illness for which home remedy would be 
adequate,	or	to	be	reffrered	to	a	doctor,	such	a	decision	would	save	lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.
u Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is 
less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a much higher chance of the children being malnourished. 
6 Access to anganwadi services
u The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the 
age	of	5.	This	could	be	a	cooked	meal,	or	in	the	form	of	take	–	home	rations.	Malnourished	children	are	to	be	given	additional	food	supplements.	For	children	below	the	age	of	two,	take	–	home	rations	"

10Counselling on Malnutrition
All the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But 
there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, many of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may	not	be	possible	 for	that	family.	For	these	reasons,	 we	have	to	do	it	in	two	
steps	–	first	an	analysis	of	why	a	child	is	malnourished	 and	once	we	have	an	
understanding of this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.
For an analysis, we need to know the following:
•	 What	is	the	nutritional	status	of	child	–	is	it	normal,	underweight,	
moderately underweight or severely underweight?
•	 What	is	the	child	being	fed	as	compared	to	what	needs	to	be	given?
•	 What	is	the	recent	history	of	child’s	illness,	and	whether	enough	has	been	
done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?
•	 What	is	the	family’s	access	to	the	three	key	services?	(ICDS,	Health	
Services	and	Public	Distribution	Services)
Skill in Eliciting Information
There is a skill of asking each question so as to get the right information.
What the child is being fed
•	 Ask	specifically	what	was 	fed	in	the	last	one	day,	starting	from	now	and	
recalling backwards, till the previous day.  
Note
Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend 
to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary. are to be given. Even pregnant women and lactating mothers up to six 
months are entitled to get food supplements in the anganwadi centres.
u Weighing the baby and informing the family of the level of 
malnutrition is another important anganwadi service. 
u The anganwadi is also the site where the Village Health and Nutrition 
Day (VHND) is conducted. The	ANM	visits	every	month	and	the	child is given immunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) packets or drugs needed for illness management."

Things to notice: how many feedings in a day, how much in each feed, whether 
the child’s food included pulses, vegetables, oil.
•	 Ask	specifically	about	protective	foods	which	are	not	given	daily.
•	 Ask	about	feeding	during	illness.	
Illness and treatment
•	 Ask	whether	 the	child	fell	ill	during	past	six	months	(ask	specifically	 about	
diarrhoea, fever, cold and cough). Start with most recent illness, and then ask	them	to	recall	backwards	 –“	before	this	when	was	he/she	sick?	etc.
•	 What	actions	did	the	family	take	during	illness?	Which	provider	did	they	
go to? 
•	 What	difficulties	did	the	family	face	in	accessing	healthcare	and	how	
much did it cost?
•	 What	are	the	likely	inessential	services	or	expenditures	which	they	are	
getting	into?
Access to anganwadi services •	 Is	the	child	taken	regularly	every	month	to	the	Anganwadi	Centre	(AWC)	
for weighing? Have they seen the growth curve?
•	 Is	the	family	availing	of	food	supplements	from	the	anganwadi,	is	it	
regular, reliable and of variety needed and reasonable quality?
Skill in Analysis 
Based upon the replies to these questions, you will form an understanding of the	multiple	 causes	of	malnutrition	 in	that	specific	child.	It	is	never	one	factor,	
Given below are examples of understanding that ASHA formed  
in two children:
Banu was a nine month old girl with moderate malnutrition. She is being 
breastfed and only this month was started on complementary food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations from there. Her immunisation is on schedule.
Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has no odema, 
but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite. He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. His immunisation schedule is complete. "

12it	is	many.	Do	not	jump	immediately	 to	some	point	
and start giving your advice. Ask all the questions, 
listen to the replies fully, think about it and then only give your advice.
Discuss what measures are needed in each case and how this is to be conveyed?
Skill of Counselling
How to give advice•	 First	praise	the	mother	for	how	well	she	is	coping	with	the	child	and	
reinforce	the	good	practices	she	is	following.	Praise	must	always	precede	any other advice.
•	 Then	deliver	each	message	as	needed	for	that	child	in	the	form	of	a	
suggestion and ask whether they could implement it. Dialogue with the family explaining why the step is needed and how they could achieve it. If they are convinced, they would agree. If not convinced or unable to agree, move on to the next message. It takes more than one visit and one dialogue for families to agree, even if it was possible.
•	 Then	point	out	any	harmful	or	wasteful	practices,	explaining	why	you 	 
say so. 
•	 Arrange	for	a	follow-up	visit	to	see	how	many	practices	have	changed	and	
to further reinforce the messages. Each family with a malnourished child needs to be met about once or twice a month. 
•	 Arrange	for	mother	and	child	to	meet	the	ANM	or	the	doctor	as	required.	
Such a visit is required in the following circumstances:
u Any child who is severely underweight. If, in addition, there are 
danger signs, admission in a facility which manages such children would be desirable. 
u	 Any	child	who	is	underweight,	who	does	not	gain	weight	even	after	a	
few months of trying to follow the advice.
u Any child who is underweight, who has fever, or chronic cough or 
persistent anaemia.
Even	if	the	family	is	not	going	to	see	the	doctor	or	ANM,	do	inform	the	Anganwadi	Worker	(AWW)	and	the	ANM	so	that	they	can	follow-up	too.	This work is equally their work also. 
How you should NOT give advice
Do	not	prescribe	advice	without	dialogue—just	telling	families	what	to	do	would not help…
Do not give very broad and what can be perceived as ‘insulting’ advice like 
–	“you	must	take	care	of	your	child,	or	you 	must	keep	the	child	clean,	or	you 	
must give nutritious food etc.”

Child Health & Nutrition 13Anaemia in the Young Child
Anaemia is important to diagnose because it commonly comes along with 
malnutrition. It may be a cause of poor appetite. Blood testing is essential, but even in its absence based on observation of pallor alone, treatment can be started. 
Looking for Anaemia in Children
Unusual	paleness	(Pallor)	of	the	skin	of	the	soles	or	palms	is	a	sign	of	anaemia.  
•	 To	see	if	the	child	has	anaemia,	look	at	the	skin	of	the	child’s	palm.	Hold	
the child’s palm open by grasping it gently from side to side.
•	 Do	not	stretch	the	fingers	backward.	This	may	cause	pallor.	•	 Compare	the	child’s	palm	with	your	own	palm	and	the	palm	of	other	
children. If the skin is paler than of others, the child has pallor. 
Treatment for anaemia is to give one tablet of paediatric iron daily. And also 
give	one	tablet	of	Albendazole	for	deworming	once	in	six	months.	For	a	child	less than two years, give half a tablet of Albendazole (Refer Annexure 6). Iron rich foods as discussed for the mother (Book 6) are also needed for the young child. If anaemia does not improve, the child must be referred to a doctor for more complete blood tests and treatment.

14Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
•	 Know	signs	of	malnutrition	in	a	sick	child.
•	 Be	able	to	classify	grades	of	malnutrition.	•	 Be	able	to	plot	weight	for	age	on	a	growth	chart.	2. Assessment of Malnutrition 
ALL sick children should be assessed for signs suggesting malnutrition.  
Check for Malnutrition
Look and Feel: 
•	 Look	for	visible	severe	wasting.
•	 Look	for	oedema	of	both	feet.•	 Determine	 grade	of	malnutrition	 by	plotting	weight	for	age	(with	AWW).
Identifying Visible Severe Wasting
• A child with visible severe wasting is very thin, has no fat, and looks like 
skin and bones. Some children are thin but do not have visible severe 
wasting. This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and referral to a hospital.
• To	look	for	visible	severe	wasting,	 remove	the	child’s	clothes.	Look	for	severe	
wasting	of	the	muscles	of	the	shoulders,	 arms,	buttocks	 and	legs.	Look	at	the	
child	from	the	side	to	see	if	the	fat	of	the	buttocks	 is	missing.	 When	wasting	is	
extreme,	 there	are	many	folds	of	skin	on	the	buttocks	 and	thigh.	
• The face of a child with visible severe wasting may still look normal. The 
child’s abdomen may be large or distended.
• Look	and	feel	to	determine	if	the	child	has	swelling	of	both	feet.	Use	your	
thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. The	child	has	oedema	if	a	dent	remains	in	the	child’s	foot	when	you 	lift	
your thumb.
Determine Grade of Malnutrition
The AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child. Every child in the village	should	be	weighed	and	his/her	weight	plotted	on	the	growth	chart.	There	is	a	separate	chart	for	boys	and	for	girls	under	the	age	of	five 	years.	
How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition:•	 The	left	hand	vertical	line	is	the	measure	of	the	child’s	weight.
•	 The	bottom	line	of	the	chart	shows	the	child’s	age	in	months.
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,15,"Part A
Child Health & Nutrition
 152. Assessment of Malnutrition •	 Find	the	point	on	the	chart	where	the	line	for	the	child’s	weight	meets	the	
line for the child’s age.
Decide where the point is in relation to the curves:
•	 If	the	point	is	below	the	bottom	most	(-3SD)	curve,	the	child	is	severely	
underweight.
•	 If	the	point	is	between	2nd and 3rd curve or exactly on the 3rd curve, the 
child is moderately underweight. 
•	 If	the	point	is	on	or	above	the	curve	marked	zero	or	between	the	curve	
zero and -2SD (second curve) or exactly on the 2nd curve, then the child is 
normal.
Community Level Care for a Malnourished Child 
All children who are underweight, should receive the following:
1. Nutritional counselling as discussed earlier 
2. Prompt	treatment	for	all	illnesses	
3. Periodic	weight	measurement	to	ensure	weight	gain	and	detect	worsening	
early. 
(a) De-worming tabs (Albendazole): Half tablet of albendazole for a child less 
than two years old and one tablet for all children above two.  
(	Based	on	the	prevalence	of	worm	infestation	in	different	areas,	the	states as per their guidelines will decide the De-worming regime for malnourished or anemic children) (see Annexure-6) 
(b) Paediatric	Iron	and	Folic	Acid	Tablets:	Daily	one	for	three	months.	
(c) A dose of Vitamin A: If this has not been given.
Remember: 
Those children who are moderately underweight, should 
be	taken	to	a	24X7	PHC	or	higher	facility	for	a	medical	consultation.	Children	who	are	severely	malnourished	need	prompt hospitalisation in a centre which manages such children.	This	is	often	the	District	Hospital.	"

Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: •	 Learn	the	skill	of	beneficiary	tracking:	listing	the	names	and	knowing	
when the next dose is due.
•	 Learn	the	skill	of	ensuring	that	the	child’s	immunisation	record	is

(b) Visit all families once in six months  at least to update 
this	list.	After	every	immunisation	session	(VHND)	
update both the village register and the child’s health card.	Learn	how	to	fill	this	village	health	register	and	child health card. You must be able to do this and teach this on your own.

(iii)	Some	children	are	more	likely	to	be	left	out	than	others.	This	includes	
physically or mentally challenged children, children of migrant families, children belonging to families considered of ‘lower status’ or	different	from	the	majority	of	the	village.	Such	children	and	such	families	are	said	to	be	‘marginalised’.	They	need	your	special	attention	and assistance.
(iv)	Some	hamlets	or	urban	slums/basti	have	neither	ANM	or	Anganwadi

204. Assessing the Sick Child
Common	illnesses	in	the	young	child	could	include:	diarrhoea,	cough	and	
cold, and fever. Each of these conditions will be discussed in the following chapters.	However,	before	you 	begin	to	learn	about	each	specific	illness,	you 	
need to know about the danger signs in a child.  
What are danger signs?
Danger signs indicate serious illness. These can occur in many illnesses. Some danger	signs	may	occur	without	any	relationship	to	the	type	of	illness.	For	example fever, diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis or malaria can all produce lethargy or unconsciousness. These illnesses can also make the child so sick that	the	child	is	not	able	to	drink	any	fluids.	These	are	called	general danger signs. The presence of even one general danger sign is enough to indicate 
a severe disease. A danger sign calls for immediate referral. Where signs of common illness like cold and cough, fever, and diarrhoea are present without any of the danger signs, and where there is no doctor, you could provide some home-based care to the child and keep a watch for signs that indicate the need for referral. 
What are the questions to be asked when seeing a sick child?
Every child who is seen for an illness should be checked for the presence of the following general danger signs: •	 Not	able	to	drink	or	breastfeed•	 Vomits	everything•	 Has	convulsions•	 Is	lethargic	or	unconscious.
How to assess a sick child for danger signs?
Step 1: ASK: Is the child able to drink or breastfeed?   A	child	has	the	sign	“not	able	to	drink	or	breastfeed” if the child is not able to suck or swallow	when	offered	a	drink	or	breast	milk.		If	the mother says that the child is not able to drink or breastfeed, ask her to describe what happens when	she	offers	the	child	something	to	drink.	For	Objectives of the session  
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
• How to identify general danger signs among sick children.
•	 Be	able	to	recognise	symptoms	of	common	illnesses.	
•	 Enable	prompt	referral.

are	not	sure	about	the	mother’s	answer,	ask	her	to	offer	the	child	a	drink	of	
clean	water	or	breast	milk.	Look	to	see	if	the	child	is	swallowing	the	water	or	breast	milk.	A	child	who	is	breastfed	may	have	difficulty	sucking	when	
his nose is blocked. If the child’s nose is blocked, clear it. If the child can breastfeed	after	his	nose	is	cleared,	the	child	does	not	have	the	danger	sign.	
Step 2: ASK : Does the child vomit everything?
A	child	who	is	not	able	to	hold	anything	down	at	all	has	the	sign	“vomits	everything.” What goes down comes back up. A child who vomits everything	will	not	be	able	to	hold	down	food,	fluids	or	oral	drugs.	A	child	who	vomits	several	times	but	can	hold	down	some	fluids	does	not	have	this	general danger sign.
Step 3: ASK: Has the child had convulsions?
Ask the mother questions on whether the child has suffered	from	convulsions	(local	term)	or	not.	
Step 4: LOOK: See if the child is lethargic or  
unconscious.The lethargic child is sleepy when the child should be awake. A child who stares blankly and does not appear to notice what is happening around is also lethargic.
The unconscious child does not waken at all. This child does not respond to 
touch, loud noise or pain.
Step 5: Ensure that the child is referred to a PHC/CHC immediately.
Remember: 
•		 All	sick	children	must	be	assessed	for	general	danger	
signs.
•	A child who has even one general danger sign has a 
severe problem. Refer this child urgently to hospital. 
•	 Complete	the	rest	of	the	assessment	and	any	pre-referral	
treatment immediately so that referral is not delayed.
If child has diarrhoea, cough and/or cold, or fever, without any of the 
danger signs, the next three chapters describe how to proceed."

22Fever	is	a	common	 problem	 among	young	children.	A	 child	with	fever	may	have	
malaria or another disease such as simple cough or cold or other viral infection. 
ASK: Does the child have fever? 
Ask the mother if the child has fever. To check 
temperature, place the thermometer in the armpit for 2 minutes.  
If you do not have a thermometer, place your hand 
on the tummy of the child to decide if the child feels hot to touch. 
Fever	is	present	if	the	mother	is	sure	that	her	child	
has had fever, measured by the thermometer, or 
if you have determined that the child feels hot to touch.5. Assessing and Classifying Fever
ASK: For how long? If more than seven days, has fever 
been present every day? 
Ask the mother how long the child has had fever. If the fever 
has been present every day for more than seven days, refer this child for further assessment. 
LOOK or FEEL for stiff neck. 
A	child	with	fever	and	stiff	neck	may	have	meningitis.	A	
child	with	meningitis	needs	urgent	treatment	with	injectable	antibiotics and referral to a hospital. 
While you talk with the mother during the assessment, look 
to see if the child moves and bends his neck easily as he looks around. If the child is moving and bending his neck, he does not have	a	stiff	neck.	
If you did not see any movement, or if you are not sure, draw the	child’s	attention	 to	his	umbilicus	 or	toes.	For	example,	 you	
can	shine	a	flashlight	 on	his	toes	or	umbilicus	 or	tickle	his	toes	
to	encourage	 the	child	to	look	down.	Look	to	see	if	the	child	can	
bend his neck when he looks down at his umbilicus or toes. Objectives of the Session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
•	 How	to	assess	the	child	for	fever.	
•	 Identify	signs	for	which	urgent	referral	is	required.•	 Start	the	first	line	of	treatment	before	referral.

24Prevention of Diarrhoea
Good hygiene practices and use of safe drinking 
water also protect against diarrhoea. Hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and water	after	defecating	and	after	contact	with	faeces, and before touching or preparing food or feeding children.  
To prevent diarrhoea, all faeces, including those 
of infants and young children, should be disposed of in a latrine or toilet or buried.  If there is no toilet or latrine, adults and children should defecate away from houses, paths, water supplies and places where children play.   Faeces	should	then	be	buried	under	a	layer	of	soil.	Human	and	animal	faeces	should be kept away from water sources. In communities without toilets or	latrines,	the	community	should	consider	joining	together	to	build	such	facilities. Households can be encouraged to build their own toilet.
Step 1: Identifying the nature of diarrhoea
• Duration:	Ask	the	mother	if	her	child	has	diarrhoea.	Passing	stools	more	
than three times a day is diarrhoea. Usually it is watery. 
• If the mother says the child has diarrhoea: Ask for how long the child has 
had diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is of 14 days or more duration, the child has severe persistent diarrhoea. This child should be referred to hospital. 
• Passing	Blood: Ask if there is blood in the stools. The child who is passing 
blood in the stools has dysentery. This child also needs referral. But one can start treatment at home also, especially if the access to a doctor is not immediately	 possible.	 The	child	should	be	treated	with	Cotrimoxazole	 at	
home (dosage as Annexure 6) and the mother should be advised home care.
Step 2: Assess every child with diarrhoea for dehydration. • Look	at	the child’s general condition. Is the child lethargic or unconscious? 
Is the child restless and irritable? 
• Look	for	sunken	eyes.6. Management of Diarrhoeal Disease
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: 
•	 Be	able	to	diagnose	dehydration	and	ascertain	if	referral	is	required.
•	 Learn	the	skill	of	preparing	and	demonstrating	ORS	use	to	the	mother/caregiver.•	 Learn	the	skill	of	counselling	the	mother	for	feeding	during	diarrhoeal	episode.

 25• Ask	the	mother	to	offer	the	child	some	water	in	a	cup	or	spoon.	Watch	
the child drink. Is the child not able to drink or is drinking poorly? Is the 
drinking eagerly, thirsty?
• A child is not able to drink  if he is not able to suck or swallow when 
offered	a	drink.	A	child	may	not	be	able	to	drink	because	he	is	lethargic	or	unconscious. 
• A child is drinking poorly  if the child is weak and cannot drink without 
help.	He	may	be	able	to	swallow	only	if	fluid	is	put	in	his	mouth.
• A child has the sign drinking eagerly, thirsty  if it is clear that the child 
wants	to	drink.	Look	to	see	if	the	child	reaches	out	for	the	cup	or	spoon	when	you 	offer	him	water.	When	the	water	is	taken	away,	see	if	the	child	
is unhappy because he wants to drink more.

 297. Management of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about:  
•	 Be	able	to	diagnose	ARI	through	measuring	fever,	observing	chest	
indrawing, and breath counting.
•	 Be	able	to	manage	mild	and	moderate	ARI	with	Contrimoxazole.
•	 Diagnose	and	refer	the	severe	cases.
Step 1: Identifying the signs of ARI
Ask	the	mother	if	the	child	has	cough	or	difficult	breathing.		If	the	mother	
says	that	the	child	has	cough	or	difficult	breathing,	ask	for	the	duration.	A	child who has had cough, even if mild, for more than 30 days, needs to be referred to hospital for further assessment. Any cough with fever for more than three days should also be referred.
Step 2: Look for chest indrawing
Chest	indrawing	in	a	child	with	cough	or	difficult	breathing	indicates	that	the	child has pneumonia.
In a child less than one year, in normal breathing, the whole chest wall (upper 
and lower) and the abdomen move OUT when the young infant breathes IN. When chest indrawing is present, the lower chest wall goes IN when the young infant breathes IN. 
In children less than one year of age, mild chest indrawing can occur. But in 
children more than one year of age, mild chest indrawing is NOT normal. 
A child with any chest indrawing should be referred to the hospital.
Count the breaths in one minute.
Count	the	breaths	the	child	takes	in	one	minute	as	ASHA	has	learnt	earlier.	Decide whether the child has normal breathing or fast breathing. 
If the child’s age is The child has fast breathing if you count
2 months up to 12 months: 50 breaths per minute or more
12 months up to 5 years: 40 breaths per minute or more
Note: The child who is exactly 12 months old has fast breathing if you count

Skills Checklist: Counting Respirations
1. Wait for the child to be quiet and calm.
2. Remove your wrist watch and hold it in one hand, close to the baby’s 
abdomen.
3. Lift up the baby’s shirt so you can see the full breath; the abdomen rising 
and falling equals one breath.
4. Count the child’s breathing for one minute.5. Record the number of breaths in a minute."

•	 Breastfeed	frequently	and	for	longer	period	at	each	feed.	Exclusively	
breastfeed for six months.
•	 Child	should	continue	to	be	given	normal	diet	during	cough	and	cold.	
This is important as this will prevent malnutrition and also help the child to recover from illness.
•	 In	case	the	child	is	not	able	to	take	the	normal	quantities	of	food,	s/he	
should be given small quantities of food frequently.
•	 Child	can	also	be	given	foods	of	thicker	consistency	such	as	khichari,	
dalia,	sooji	or	rice	in	milk,	idli	etc..
•	 Small	 quantities	 of	oil/ghee	should	be	added	to	the	food	to	provide	extra	
energy. 
•	 After	the	illness,	at	least	one	extra	meal	should	be	given	to	the	child	for	at	
least a week to help the child in speedy recovery.
•	 Give	increased	amounts	of	fluids.
•	 Give	extra	fluids	(as	much	as	the	child	will	take),	such	as	dal	soup,	
vegetable	soup,	plain	clean	water	or	other	locally	available	fluids.	
•	 Always	feed	from	a	cup	or	spoon.	Never	use	a	bottle.For	babies	over	six	months	of	age,	soothe	the	throat	and	relieve	the	cough	
with a safe home-made cough remedy (made into a tea) such as:
•	 Sugar,	ginger,	lemon,	tulsi	leaves	or	mint.•	 Sonf,	elaichi,	ginger.
Any other local practice that is soothing and is not unpleasant or harmful 
could also be encouraged, for example the application of luke-w

1. Safe Abortion1
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: •	 Be	able	to	advise	on	method,	based	on	duration	of	pregnancy.•	 Understand	the	risks	of	unsafe	abortions,	and	know	where	safe	abortion	
services	are	available	in	her	area.
•	 Help	women	in	need	of	such	services	to	access	safe	abortion	services.•	 Be	able	to	identify	signs	of	post	abortal	complications	and	advise	
appropriate	referral.
•	 Counsel	for	appropriate	contraception	after	the	abortion.
A woman seeks abortion because:
•	 She	does	not	want	more	children	and	has	not	used	a	contraceptive	method	
properly	or	the	method	failed.
•	 A	pregnancy	can	endanger	her	life.	•	 She	has	no	partner	who	will	help	support	child.	•	 She	got	pregnant	after	rape.	•	 The	child	will	be	born	with	serious	birth	defects.
When	a	woman	is	faced	with	an	unwanted	pregnancy,	she	should	be	able	to	
get	a	safe	abortion.
Legality:	In	India,	abortions	are	legal	up	to	20	weeks.	They	are	legal	only	if	
done	by	a	qualified	practitioner.	Up	to	12	weeks,	one	doctor	can	do	it.	After	 12	weeks,	two 	doctors	need	to	sign	the	consent	form.	Abortion	services	are	
free	in	all	government	hospitals.	Women	over	18	do	not	need	anyone	else	to	sign	a	consent	form.

36Safety:	Abortion	is	very	safe	if	done	by	an	experienced	health	worker.	In	India,	
only	a	doctor	can	perform	an	abortion,	and	this	should	be	done	under	clean	conditions,	and	with	proper	instruments.	
Abortion	 is	often	difficult	to	get	because,	 there	are	not	enough	service	providers 	
and	facilities.	 Those	providers	 who	do	provide	abortion	 services	may	charge	a	
lot	of	money	or	not	even	be	legal	providers	 of	safe	abortion	 services.	
If you are helping someone decide about an abortion
She	needs	respectful	 advice	and	friendly	support.	 Do	not	tell	anyone	else,	not	
even	her	family	members,	 about	her	decision	 unless	she	wants	others	to	know.
Abortion is unsafe when it is done:
•	 By	someone	who	has	not	been	trained	to	do	it.•	 With	the	wrong	instruments	or	medicines.•	 Under	unclean	conditions.The	later	in	pregnancy	the	abortion	is	undertaken,	the	more	risky	it	becomes.	
Methods: All these methods can only be done by a trained,  
legal provider
• Medical Abortion:	This	can	be	done	only	in	very	early	pregnancies	less	
than	seven	weeks	or	49	days	after	last	missed	period.	The	woman	is	
advised	to	take	tablets,	but	this	should	be	prescribed	by	and	supervised	by	a	legal	provider.	
• Manual Vacuum Aspiration: 	This	
method	involves	the	woman	staying	in	the	health	facility	for	a	few	hours.	It	can	be	done	up	to	eight	weeks	of	pregnancy.	
•	 Dilatation	and	curettage	(D	and	C):	This	
method
	can	be	done	up	to	12	weeks	of	
pregnancy.	It	is	associated	with	a	higher	risk	of	complications.	
Post-abortion care
You should advise women• To	avoid	sex	or	putting	anything	in	the	vagina	for	at	least	five 	days	after	the	
abortion.	
• Drink	plenty	of	fluids	for	faster	recovery.	
• Some	bleeding	from	vagina	for	up	to	two 	weeks	is	normal,	but	it	should	be	
light.	Next	monthly	period	will	be	after	4-6	weeks.	
• That	the	risk	of	pregnancy	 exists	as	soon	as	intercourse	 is	resumed	 regardless 	
of	monthly	 period.	T herefore	a	 contraceptive	 should	be	used.

382. Family Planning
The	main	focus	of	the	chapter2	is	to	provide	ASHA	with	skills	such	as	
understanding	contraceptive	needs	of	the	community,	enabling	them	to	make	
an	informed	choice,	and	ensuring	access	to	contraceptive	services.	She	will	also	learn	the	skill	of	maintaining	and	updating	the	list	of	eligible	couples	in	her	community	in	the	Health	Register.	
2		Family	Planning	has	been	covered	in	Books	1	and	2	in	some	detail.	Book	1	also	provides	
an	understanding	of	the	menstruation-fertility	links.	This	chapter	is	intended	to	serve	as	a	refresher,	and	builds	on	the	ASHA’s	existing	knowledge.	Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Be	able	to	develop	line	lists	of	eligible	couples	for	identification	and	 
follow-up.
• Understand	the	side-effects	of	the	methods	to	counsel	the	woman	to	
continue	with	the	method	or	seek	appropriate	assistance.	
• Be	able	to	assess	which	methods	are	suitable	for	couples/individuals	
based	on	their	marital	status,	number	of	children,	child	bearing	intentions,	
and	the	mother’s	health	status,	and	counsel	for	method	use	based	on	
informed	choice.	
• Be	able	to	counsel	for	delay	in	age	of	marriage,	delay	in	age	of	first	child	
bearing	and	in	child	spacing.
• Provide	contraceptive	services	like:	(i)	Condoms,	(ii)	Emergency	
Contraceptive	Pills	(ECP),	and	(iii)	Re-supply	of	Oral	Contraceptive	Pills	(OCP),	and	maintain	sufficient	stocks	and	client	records.
• Provide	information	on	where,	when	and	how	to	access	other	methods	
(sterilisation,	Intra	Uterine	Contraceptive	Device	(IUCD),	starting	the	use	of	OCP)	and	provide	information	on	compensation	for	sterilisation	and	IUCD	services	and	family	planning	insurance	scheme.
• Assist ANM in follow-up	of	contraceptive	users.
• Identify	side-effects	and	user	problems	in	contraceptive	users	and	counsel	
and	refer	appropriately.	
• Help	poor	families	access	contraception.

 39Women’s Needs for Family Planning
Different	women	and	couples	have	different	needs	for	contraception.	When	
you	counsel	a	woman	on	family	planning,	you 	should	keep	in	mind	the	
following:	
• Marital status: 
u Unmarried:	condoms	or	pills	or	emergency	pills	
 u Newly	married	and	wanting	to	delay	the	first	child:	condoms	or	pills
• Just	delivered	(postpartum)	or	just	had	an	abortion	(post-abortal):	
condoms,	pills,	IUCD	(after	six	weeks),	injectables  (currently	not	available	
in	the	public	sector,	but	being	used	in	the	private	sector)
• Wanting	to	space	children:	condoms,	pills,	IUCD,	injectables.
• Not	wanting	more	children:	Long	acting	(10)	IUCD	and	sterilisation	for	
the	man	or	the	woman.
Types of Family Planning Methods and Information on Side-Effects 
The Pill
If	a	woman	takes	birth	control	pills	every	day,	pills	will	protect	her	from	pregnancy	for	the	entire	monthly	cycle.	These	pills	are	called	Mala N or Mala D.	Pills	should	be	provided	to	those	women	who	are	specifically	advised	by	the	doctor.	However,	since	you 	are	required	to	dispense	these,	it	is	important	
for	you	to	know	a	few	important	facts.	
Taking	pills	may	be	dangerous	for	women	with	the	following	signs:•	 Woman	has	jaundice,	recognised	by	yellow	skin	and	eyes.
•	 Woman	has	ever	had	signs	of	a	stroke,	paralysis	or	heart	disease.•	 Woman	has	ever	had	a	blood	clot	in	the	veins	of	her	legs.	
•	
If	the	woman	smokes	and	is	over	35	years	old.	
•	 Has	high	blood	pressure	(more	than	140/90).	If	the	woman	has	any	of	the	problems	listed	above,	the	doctor	would	then	
counsel	her	to	use	a	method	other	than	the	pills.	
Side-effects of pills
The	pills	contain	the	same	chemicals	that	a	woman’s	body	makes	when	she	is	pregnant.	So	she	may	have	the	following	side-effects:•	 Nausea
•	 Headaches•	 Swelling	of	legs•	 Changes	in	monthly	period.Side-effects	often	get	better	after	the	first	2	or	3	months.	If	they	do	not,	and	
they	are	annoying	or	worrying	her,	you 	should	advise	the	woman	to	see	an	
ANM	or	doctor.

40Pills	should	not	be	advised	for	women	who	are	breastfeeding.	
OCP	are	available	in	your	drug	kit,	and	at	the	Sub-Centre,	Primary	Health	
Centre	(PHC)	and	Community	Health	Centre	(CHC).	
Emergency Contraceptive Pills
ASHA does not start women on a pill, but could provide follow-up once it is started. These are	for	emergency	use,	when	the	couple	has	not	used	a	
contraceptive	and	have	had	unprotected	sex.	It	can	also	be	used	in	instances	of	rape,	or	accidental	breaking	of	the	condom.	The	woman	must	take	the	pill	as	soon	as	possible	after	unprotected	sex.	The	pills	are	effective	within	72 hours	of	intercourse.	The	pills	will	not	work	if	the	woman	has	already	become	pregnant	from	having	sex	more	than	three	days	earlier.	These	pills	are	available	in	your	drug	kit,	at	the	Sub-Centre,	PHC	and	CHC.	These	pills	are	to	be	used	only	as	an	emergency	method	and	you 	should	advise	users	to	
shift	to	regular	methods	of	family	planning.
Condom:	The	condom	is	a	narrow	bag	of	thin	rubber	that	the	man	wears	on	
his	penis	during	sex. Because	the	man’s	semen	stays	in	the	bag,	the	sperm	cannot	enter	the	woman’s	body,	and	she	cannot	get	pregnant.	The	condom	is	a	useful	device	to	be	used	as	a	contraceptive	and	to	protect	against	Sexually	Transmitted	Infections	(STIs)	and	HIV.	It	is	also	useful	for	couples	where	the	
male
	is	a	migrant	and	returns	home	for	short	durations.
Men	most	often	buy	condoms	from	shops.	Since	you 	have	a	supply	of	
condoms	in	your	drug	kit,	women	may	feel	more	confident	in	approaching	you	to	obtain	condoms.	
The Intrauterine Contraceptive Device (IUCD, Copper-T, the Loop)The	IUCD	is	a	small	object	or	device	that	is	inserted	into	the	uterus	and	prevents	the	man’s	sperm	from	fertilising	the	woman’s	egg.	The	IUCD	can	stay	in	the	uterus	for	up	to	10	years.	The	most	common	IUCDs	are	made	of	copper.	
Remember:
8	 	 A	condom	is	to	be	used	every	time	the	woman	has	a	
sexual	encounter	to	prevent	from	pregnancy,	STIs	 and	HIV.	
8	 	 A	condom	is	to	be	used	only	once.	A	condom	that	has	
been	used	before	is	more	likely	to	break.
8	 	 Condoms	are	to	be	kept	in	a	cool,	dry	place	away	from	
sunlight.	Condoms	that	are	from	old	or	torn	package	are	more	likely	to	break.

 41Who should not use an IUCD?
You	should	not	counsel	IUCD	use	if	the	woman:
• Has	never	been	pregnant.
• Has	anaemia	(Low	Hb).
• Is	in	danger	of	getting	a	Sexually	Transmitted	Infection.	(This	includes	any	
woman	who	has	more	than	one	partner,	or	whose	partner	may	have	other	sex	partners.)
• Has	ever	had	an	infection	in	her	tubes	or	uterus,	or	an	infection	after	
giving	birth	or	having	an	abortion.	
• Has	had	a	pregnancy	in	her	tubes.
• Has	a	lot	of	bleeding	and	pain	during	monthly	bleeding.
Common	side-effects:	The	woman may	have	some	light	bleeding	during	the	first	week	after	getting	an	IUCD.	Some	women	also	have	longer,	heavier	and	more	painful	monthly	bleeding,	but	this	usually	stops	after	the	first	three	months.
Who	should	insert	an	IUCD:	 An	IUCD	must	be	inserted	by	a	trained	
Auxiliary	Nurse	Midwife	(ANM),	nurse	or	a	doctor	after	doing	a	pelvic	
(internal)	examination.	The	best	time	to	have	the	IUCD	inserted	is	during	the	monthly	bleeding/period.	The	IUCD	can	be	inserted	within	48	hours	of	delivery	by	a	trained	healthcare	provider,	by	a	method	known	as	Postpartum Intrauterine	Contraceptive	Device	(PPIUCD).	However	if	the	IUCD	cannot	be	inserted	within	48	hours	of	delivery	for	any	reason	or	complications	then	
it
	is	best	to	wait	for	six	weeks	for	the	uterus	to	return	to	its	normal	size	and	
shape	before	getting	an	IUCD.	
What to watch for:	Occasionally	an	IUCD	will	slip	out	of	place.	If	this	
happens,	it	will	not	be	effective	in	preventing	pregnancy,	so	it	is	important	
Teaching a woman to check the IUD strings
• Wash hands.
• Squat down and reach as far as she can into the vagina with two fingers. 
Feel for the IUD strings, but do not pull them.
• Take fingers out and wash her hands again.
for	the	woman	to	learn	to	check	her	IUCD	to	make	sure	it	is	still	in	place.	Most	IUCDs	have	2	thread-like	strings	attached	which	hang	down	into	the	vagina.	The	mother	should	be	counselled	to	check	the	strings	after	each	monthly	bleeding	to	make	sure	the	IUCD	is	in	place."

42Sterilisation (the operation when the couple wants no more children)
• Since	these	operations	are	permanent,	they	are	only	good	for	those	
women	or	men	who	are	certain	that	they	do	not	want	any	more	children.
• To	have	one	of	these	operations,	the	woman	must	go	to	a	PHC	or	CHC.	
The	surgery	is	fast	and	safe,	and	does	not	cause	side-effects.	
• The	services	for	sterilisation	are	provided	on	certain	days	in	these	centres.	
You	must	know	the	nearest	site	where	this	service	is	available	and	on	
what	days.	
• When	needed,	the	ASHA	could	accompany	the	woman	to	the	facility	
for	the	tubectomy	procedure.	Often	because	of	the	case	
overload,	quality	of	services	is	not	assured	and	the	ASHA	should	help	the	woman	receive	good	quality	care.	Accompanying	is	desirable,	but	not	mendatory.
The operation for the man (Vasectomy)A	vasectomy	is	a	simple	operation,	with	only	a	small	puncture	to	block	the	tubes	that	carry	the	sperm.	It	takes	only	a	few	minutes	to	do.	The operation does not change a man’s ability to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure.	He	still	ejaculates	semen	but	there	are	no	sperm	in	the	semen.	The	couple	must	be	advised	to	use	condoms	or	other	contraceptives	for	90	days	following	vasectomy.	
The operation for the woman (Tubectomy) 
A	tubal	ligation	is	a	slightly	more	difficult	operation	than	a	vasectomy,	but	it	is	still	very	safe.	It	takes	about	30	minutes.	
A	
trained	doctor	makes	a	small	cut	in	the	woman’s	abdomen,	and	then	cuts	
or	ties	the	tubes	that	carry	the	egg	to	the	womb.	The	woman	can	have	the	
operation	within	seven	days	of	the	start	of	the	menstrual	cycle,	24	hours	after	delivery,	or	six	weeks	after	the	delivery.	
Important 
Sterilisation and pills do not protect against STIs and Human Immuno-deficiency 
Virus (HIV). So, for protection from STIs and HIV, a condom should be used during every sexual intercourse, if the woman is at risk of contracting them. "

443. Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) and  
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)
Objective of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Understand	RTI/STI	and	HIV/AIDS
3; prevention,	management	and	
treatment.
• Be	able	to	counsel	women	on	protection	from	RTI/STI	and	HIV/AIDS.
• Be	able	to	guide	women	to	appropriate	facilities	for	testing	and	treatment.
3		This	section	has	also	been	covered	in	Book	3.	Thus,	this	session	is	expected	to	serve	as	a	
refresher	course.	Is white discharge normal?
• Some	amount	of	white	discharge	is	normal.	It	is	the	vagina’s	way 	of	
cleansing	itself.	
• The	amount	of	discharge	varies	during	different	phases	of	the	menstrual	
cycle.	During	the	fertile	period	it	is	wet 	and	slippery,	and	clear.	
• During	pregnancy,	the	discharge	increases	in	amount.
• Discharge	that	is	bad	smelling	(smell	of	menstrual	blood,	fishy	odour),	
white	lumpy	discharge	(curd,	coloured	greenish,	yellowish,	reddish,	
bloody),	accompanied	by	itching,	a	rash,	sores,	burning	urination,	and	lower	abdominal	pain,	pain	during	intercourse	is	indicative	of	RTI	or	STI.	
• A	change	in	colour	and	odour	is	an	alert	to	the	women	of	a	possible	
infection.	In	addition,	if	there	is	itching	or	burning,	there	is	high	possibility	of	an	infection.	
• Discharge	is	also	indicative	of	certain	hormonal	problems	or	even	cancer.
What are STIs? 
STIs	are	infections	that	are	passed	from	an	infected	person	to	another	during	sexual	intercourse.	Mothers	can	pass	on	STIs	to	babies	during	the	delivery	process.	
Most	STIs	are	RTIs.	However	a	few	like	Hepatitis-B	and	HIV	are	STIs	but	not	
RTIs.	Many	Reproductive	Tract	Infections	are	Sexually	Transmitted	Infections.	However	many	other	Reproductive	Tract	Infections	are	contracted	by	other	means	e.g.	post	childbirth	or	abortion	or	from	GI	infections.	
Why are STIs serious problem for women? 
• Because	the	infected	semen	stays	longer	inside	a	women’s	body.	
• The	entire	genital	tract	in	women	is	hidden,	therefore,	the	infection	stays	
inside	for	a	longer	time	and	is	silent	for	longer.
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,45,"Part B
Women’s Reproductive Health 
 45• It	is	harder	for	a	woman	to	protect	herself	from	STIs,	because	she	is	often	
unable	to	negotiate	with	the	male	partner	to	use	a	condom.
What are the consequences of STIs?
STIs	can	cause:	
• infertility	in	men	and	women;	
• babies	to	be	born	too	early,	too	small	or	blind;	and	
• long	lasting	pain	in	lower	abdomen,	or	even	cancer.
• Death	from	severe	infection	or	AIDS
What are the signs of RTIs?
Signs	of	RTIs	include:• Abnormal	discharge	
• Lower	abdominal	pain	
• Rash,	Swelling	in	the	groin	or	sore	in	genital	area.	
However,	these	signs	manifest	very	late.	It	is	best	to	be	aware	that	a	woman	can	be	at	risk	for	an	STI	if:• Husband	has	signs	of	an	STI.
• Either	the	man	or	woman	has	more	than	one	sexual	partner.	
• In	some	occupations	which	require	long	period	of	travel	and	where	the	
men	engage	in	casual	sex.	
Tasks for ASHA to be involved in are:
• Counsel	women	at	risk	on	preventive	measures.
• Counsel	women	with	symptoms	of	RTI/STI	to	go	to	the	health	facility	for	
treatment.	All	24X7	PHCs	or	higher	facilities	are	equipped	and	skilled	to	provide	necessary	care.
• Take	the	course	of	medicine	fully	(all	courses	are	for	a	week	or	ten	days).	
You	should	motivate	the	woman	to	complete	the	course	of	medicines.	Not	
completing 
	the	course	of	medicines	makes	the	bacteria	resistant	and	can	
cause	a	worse	infection	that	does	not	respond	to	drugs	the	next	time.
• Ensure	that	the	husband	also	gets	treated.
• Counsel	a	women	to abstain	from	sexual	activity	during	the	period	of	
treatment.
• If	the	husband	is	known	to	indulge	in	extra-marital	relationships,	counsel	
the	woman	to	avoid	having	unprotected	sex.
Where to get treatment for RTI/STI
•	 All	drugs	for	STI	treatment	are	available	free	of	cost	from	PHC	upwards.
•	 ANM	and	the	PHC	doctor	can	provide	treatment."

•	 If	repeated	STIs	occur,	testing	can	be	done	at	District	Hospital	for	Below	
Poverty	people	Line	(BPL),	free	for	others.
HIV and AIDS
You	can	increase	awareness	on	HIV	and	AIDS:	On	its	transmission,	its	
prevention	and	services	available.	You 	can	also	help	in	reducing	myths	and	
misconception	as	well	as	stigma	and	discrimination	associated	with	it.	 know 
the	following:• HIV	is	transmitted	 through:	 a)	having	unprotected	 sex	(sex	without	condom); 	
b)	receiving	 HIV	infected	blood	or	blood	products;	 c)	using/sharing 	
unsterilised	 needles	or	lancets;	and	d)	from	HIV	infected	mother	to	her	baby.	
• It	does	not	spread	through	any	other	mode	such	as	kissing	and	touching,	
holding	hands,	mosquito	bites,	sharing	clothes,	or	through	saliva,	nose	
fluids,	tears.	
• Who	is	at	higher	risk:	Commercial	Sex	Workers	(CSWs),	Injecting	Drug	
Users	(IDUs),	Men	who	have	Sex	with	Men	(MSM),	migrant	labourers,	persons	with	multiple	sexual	partners,	babies	born	to	mothers	who	are	HIV	infected,	and	persons	with	other	STIs.	
• Persons	with	HIV	are	at	greater	risk	of	getting	Tuberculosis.	Every	1	in	20	
persons	suffering	from	TB	in	India	is	also	HIV	infected.	
• HIV	can	be	prevented	by	using	condom	during	sexual	intercourse	
(protected
	sex),	using	safe	blood	(when	blood	transfusions	are	necessary)	
from	blood	bank	of	government	hospitals	or	recognised	hospitals	only,	using	sterilised	needles/avoid	sharing	of	needles,	and	by	avoiding	sex	with	multiple	partners.	
• HIV	testing	and	management	facility	is	available	in	the	District	Hospital	free	
of	cost.	Treatment	services	for	AIDS	are	available	in	some	district	hospitals	or	in	the	main	government	hospital	in	the	big	cities.	
• You	should	encourage	persons	at	high	risk	to	go	for	HIV	test.	If	women	who	
are	at	high	risk	become	pregnant,	they	must	be	motivated	to	gets	tested,	as	timely	treatment	may	prevent	transmission	of	HIV	from	HIV	infected	mother	to	baby.	
For cure of STIs, medicines are necessary, but for relief you could 
advice the woman to: 
• Sit in a pan of clean, warm water for 15 minutes. Add lemon juice to the water.
• Do not have sex until she feels better.
• Try to wear cotton next to the skin.
• Wash undergarments every day.
• Pour clean water on genitals after passing urine."

1. High Risk Assessment and Management of Low Birth  
Weight/Pre-Term Babies
Identifying a high risk baby and what to do?
Objectives of the session
By the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Diagnose	which	babies	are	at	high	risk.
• Diagnose	and	refer	high	risk	children.
• Counsel	the	mother	on	how	to	breastfeed	a	pre-term/Low	Birth	Weight	
(LBW)	newborn.
• Teach	mothers	to	express	milk	and	feed	such	babies	using	a	bowl	 
or	spoon.
Guidelines for ASHA on identifying a high risk baby
•	 Birth	weight	less	than	2000	gm.•	 Pre-term	(delivery	which	happens	when	mother	is	8	months	and	14	days	
pregnant	or	less).
•	 Baby	not	taking	feeds	on	Day	1.If	you	were	not	present	at	the	time	of	delivery	and	your	first	visit	to	the	
newborn	is	delayed,	then	the	newborn	is	to	be	weighed	on	the	day	of	your	
first	visit.	In	such	cases,	using	the	following	table,	determine	whether	the	baby	is	high	risk	or	not:
Day on which baby is 
weighed for the first timeWeight of baby Diagnosis
1 to 14 days Less than 2 kg High Risk Baby
15 to 21 days Less than 2 kg 100 gm High Risk Baby
22 to 27 days Less than 2 kg 200 gm High Risk Baby
28th day Less than 2 kg 300 gm High Risk Baby
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,50,"ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
50What should you do if the baby is at high risk?
• Increase	the	number	of	home	visits	after	delivery	from	5	to	13.	
• A	daily	visit,	if	possible,	for	the	first	week.	
• Once	every	three	days	until	the	baby	is	28	days	old,	and	if	the	baby	is	
improving	once	on	the	42nd	day.	
• Weigh	the	babies	on	Day	7,	14,	21,	28.	Babies	who	weigh	less	than	2300	
gm	on	the	28th	day	have	a	higher	risk	of	dying.	If	the	baby	is	not	gaining	
weight,	refer	the	baby	to	the	hospital.	
• Explain	the	high	risk	issues	to	the	parents	and	family	(see	box	above).
• Provide	specific	care	as	per	the	problem	but	in	general,	keep	the	baby	
warm	and	breastfeed	more	often	every	two 	hours.
• For	poor	breastfeeding,	observe	the	mother	breastfeeding.	Ensure	proper	
latch	on	and	positioning.	Encourage	the	mother	so	that	she	is	motivated

Newborn Health2. Breastfeeding Low Birth Weight/Pre-Term babies
Advantages of breast milk for LBW and pre-term Babies
• Has	the	right	nutrients	for	the	pre-term/LBW	baby
• Pre-term	babies	need	more	protein	and	a	mother	who	has	delivered	 
pre-term	has	more	breast	milk.
• Is	easily	digestible.
• Contains	factors	to	fight	infection	(small	babies	are	more	vulnerable	 
to	disease).
• Breastfeeding	keeps	the	baby	close	to	the	mother	and	therefore,	warm.	
This	protects	the	pre-term	baby	from	cold	(Hypothermia),	which	can	lead	
to	infection.
Key Messages
For small babies who can suckle
• Try the underarm hold for more support or the alternate underarm hold.
• If sleeping, wake baby every 2-3 hours for breastfeeding by rubbing a 
damp cloth over its face.
For babies who are not able to suckle: 
• Babies	less	than	1500	gm	may	not	be	able	to	breastfeed	in	the	beginning.
• Express	milk	by	applying	gentle	pressure	over	entire	breast	and	collect	 
milk	in	a	clean	bowl.
• Express	milk	every	2-3	hours	to	keep	the	milk	supply	up.	
• Put	baby	to	breast	and	allow	her	to	lick	the	nipple,	and	try	to	suckle.
• Once	the	baby	is	able	to	suckle,	she	should	be	put	to	the  breast	as	often	as	
possible	to	stimulate	milk	production.
• Continue	feeding	with	the	spoon	as	well	until	the	baby	is	getting	its	milk	
requirements	directly	from	the	breast.
How much to give?
• For	a	LBW	baby:	For	first	day	60	ml/kg	body	weight.	
• Add	20	ml/kg	body	weight	until	baby	is	taking	200	ml	per	day.
• Divide 	the	total	into	8-12	feeds	(every	2-3	hours).
• Colostrum	can	be	kept	for	up	to	12	hours	at	room	temperature.
• Mature	milk	(after	first	72	hours)	can	be	kept	for	6-8	hours	at	room	temperature.

523. Asphyxia Diagnosis and Management
What is Asphyxia?
A baby having any one of the following symptoms at the time of birth is 
asphyxiated: 
• No cry
• Weak cry
• No breathing
• Weak breathing.
If	a	baby	has	asphyxia,	it	is	an	Emergency.	A	life	can	be	saved	or	lost	in	these	
five	minutes.	If	you 	are	present	at	the	time	of	birth,  and	there	is	no	doctor	or	
nurse,	you 	should	try	to	help	to	manage	the	baby.	However,	in	many	such	
newborns,	your	efforts	may	not	make	enough	difference	and	you 	should	not	
feel	bad	or	blame	yourself	for	this.	Depending	on	the	area	in	which	you 	work,	
you	may	be	trained	in	using	a	bag	and	mask	to	treat	asphyxia	as	in	Annexe	3.
Consequences of Asphyxia 
Immediate (at birth)• Baby	is	born	dead	(stillbirth)
• Dies	at	once	or	within	a	few	days
• Unable	to	suckle.
Long termIf	the	baby	survives,	it	may	have:
• Mental retardation
• Epilepsy	(seizures	and	fits)
• Spasticity	(difficulty	walking	or	moving	arms	and	hands).
These signs warn of asphyxia during labour

Community Level Care for Malaria in Areas where Malaria is endemic 
Malaria
Malaria is an infection caused by parasite (microorganism) called 
Plasmodium. This is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito. There are two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very dangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs. 
How does it spread?: When the mosquito bits an infected person, the parasite 
enters the mosquito’s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’s stomach and then when it bites another person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’s saliva and infects him/her . 
Signs and Symptoms
• The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur 
on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with Falciparum type infection. 
• Sometimes the patient has continuous fever, malaise, and headache.
• Malaria affects more frequently and more severely children below five 
years, pregnant women, or patients who are already ill. 
• Falciparum malaria can affect the brain: causing clouding of 
consciousness, fits, or paralysis leading to death.Objectives of the sessionBy the end of the session, the ASHA will learn about: • Understand and be able to communicate key facts about malaria and its 
prevention.
• Making a blood smear and testing blood using a rapid diagnostic test for malaria. • Managing fever in the young child- when to suspect malaria, how and when to 
test, when to refer, when and what to treat.
• Understanding spread of TB and methods of diagnosis. • Supporting treatment of TB and follow-up with patients."
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,60,"ASHA Module 7

60Who is at higher risk? : In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant 
mothers and malnourished children are at greater risk.
How to suspect malaria: Any person living in a malaria affected area, who 
develops fever must be suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and rigor and headache, it is even more likely. 
How to confirm:  There are two ways of confirming malaria:
• Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit the patient’s blood can be tested 
for malaria (Please see Annexe 4). If the test is positive then the patient 
has malaria. 
• You should also make a blood smear. (Please see Annexe 5). The parasite 
can be seen in the blood smear Sometimes the blood smears can be negative, and a repeat smear is required. 
 RDT and Smears are to be taken before starting treatment. All ASHAs 
working in a block with a high incidence of malaria need to be trained for taking smears for malaria. 
Treating Malaria
1. Give paracetamol for fever. Also sponging with warm water to bring 
down temperature when needed.
2. If RDT is positive for malaria- Give chloroquine or Artesunate 
Combination treatment (ACT) drug as recommended. (Annexe 7) The dose of the drug depends of the age group. The exact dosage schedule is given in Annexe 6. Nowadays the recommendation is to treat for malaria only if the test is positive. If the test is not available, or cannot be done, it is permissible to give a course of chloroquine. This would still be needed in many areas. 
3. If despite treatment fever does not begin to come down within two or 
three days, or persists even after a week, referral becomes mandatory. 
Referral to ANM or doctor is necessary if there is no response and fever continues 
or if patient becomes delirious. 
Prevention of Malaria
Mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There 
are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito that transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at night. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in clean water. That is why during rainy season, where water collects, this forms a good breeding place for mosquitoes. 
ASHA Module 7
or if patient becomes delirious. 
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,61,"Part D
Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 61Ways of controlling malaria: There are two ways:
Do not allow mosquitoes to multiply :
• Spraying insecticide where mosquitoes sit when they 
come to bite inside the houses.
• Drying up breeding pits.
• Not allowing water to stagnate- pouring a spoon of 
oil over the water surface in small collections. This is 
enough to kill the mosquito larvae. 
• Enable cultivation of Gambusia fish in ponds and 
wells- these eat up the mosquito larvae. Also remove the grass from banks of pond. Larvae find it difficult to breed if there is no vegetation and the pond edges are vertical. 
• Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in 
one place and it should be flushed and cleaned once in a week.
Do not allow mosquitoes to bite• Clothes that cover the body, like full sleeved shirts. 
• Mosquito nets treated with 
insecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net may die later. 
• Use of mosquito repellent, e.g. 
burning neem leaves to drive mosquitoes away.
The Role of ASHA in Prevention and Management of Malaria
i. During house visits and in the village meetings you should inform 
the community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. You should also inform the community of the services you can provide for malaria and request that for any case of fever you should be contacted.
ii. Encourage and help the village health and sanitation committee and the 
women’s groups or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. 
iii. Where possible, ask those with fever, who you suspect of having malaria 
to go to the primary health centre. You should facilitate this. It is only if the patient cannot go the same day, that you should take on the task of diagnosis and treatment of the suspected patient with malaria till such time as the qualified service provider is accessed. 
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,62,"ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
62iv. All fever cases that approach you and are unable to go to the primary 
health centre within a day, should be screened using RDT and blood 
slides. Fever cases which turn out to be RDT positive should be provided treatment immediately. You should store the positive RDT along with the blood slide for Quality Assurance (QA) check at a later date. For cases which are RDT negative, you should send blood slides to the laboratory. For those with a positive result, you can treat the cases following the drug regimen in which you are trained. 
v. All fever cases should be given paracetamol and fever managed as per 
the guidelines. The persons who test positive for malaria would be given with either chloroquine drug or ACT drugs (depending on the instructions in that area) followed by primaquine for radical treatment. 
vi. Whenever you do a blood test or give a drug you should make a record 
of it in your diary. You should, provide the information during the monthly ASHA review meeting to the ANM or to your supervisor. If payment is being made for this work, you may be also required to maintain a register.
vii. Transport of slides and obtaining the result of the test: The 
slides collected by you should be delivered to the sub-centre by you or by anyone whom you request, on a day to day basis. These slides should then be transported to the PHC lab preferably twice a week, or less by the MPW (M) and if not, the MPW (F). The results should be conveyed to you by the MPW (M) and if not the MPW (F). 
viii. If there is a pregnant woman in a high malaria area, you 
should facilitate her getting a insecticide treated bed net at the time of the first antenatal care check up and follow up to see that she uses it. After delivery you should ensure that the baby from the time of birth also sleeps under an insecticide treated bed-net. Diary
ix. If a pregnant woman gets high fever and chills, ensure that she is taken to see a doctor. You could start Chloroquine or ACT  immediately if there is a delay in seeing a doctor.. Do NOT give primaquine to a pregnant woman or a child below one year of age. "

Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 63Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious bacterial disease caused by a germ 
(Mycobacterium tuberculosis). TB can affect any part of the body. When it affects the lungs, it is called pulmonary TB. The commonest form of TB is pulmonary TB. It affects over 2 million people in India. TB in any other part of the body (i.e. other than lungs) is called extra-pulmonary TB.
How does TB spread?
TB germs usually spread through tiny droplets in the air, when a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis coughs or sneezes. When these droplets are inhaled by a healthy person, s/he gets infected with TB. This infected person will have a 10% lifetime risk of developing TB. Spread of disease is increased in poorly ventilated houses where many people live close together or in high dust areas like mines and quarries. An undernourished or malnourished patient is also at a high risk of contracting and dying of TB. Both drugs and nourishment are needed to achieve a cure in such persons. Children can also get both forms of TB.
 When should TB be suspected?
The symptoms of pulmonary TB are:• Cough with sputum for two weeks or more
• Pain in chest• Sometimes the presence of blood stained sputum (haemoptysis) with 
symptoms like:
u Rise in evening temperature
u Night sweats
u Loss of weight
u Loss of appetite.
A person with cough for two weeks or more is a suspect for TB and should be 
referred to a PHC/CHC/DH for the confirmation of diagnosis. 
How to diagnose TB?
Sputum examination is the main tool for diagnosing pulmonary TB.
The diagnosis is made when the germ is present in the sputum of the 
patient. At least two sputum samples have to be tested (one of which has to be collected first thing in the morning at the patient’s home and the other at the health facility). A receptacle for collection of sputum at home is given to the patient at the microscopy centre at the health facility). The two samples should be collected for examination preferably within 24 hours. The sputum is stained by a special dye and examined under a microscope by trained personnel. 
"
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,64,"ASHA Module 7
Simple Skills that Save Lives
64The person is said to be a TB patient if the germ is detected in both or one of 
the two samples. Patients who are sputum negative for germs but who still exhibit disease symptoms should be referred to the Medical Officer (MO) who may order other investigations like an X-ray of the lungs.
 Diagnosis of TB must be done by a Medical Officer.
What is DOTS?
DOTS programme is “Directly Observed Treatment” in which a health worker or another trained person who is not a family member, watches as the patient swallows the anti-TB medicines in her presence.
What is ‘Cure’?
A patient who is initially sputum smear-positive and who has completed treatment and had negative sputum smears on two occasions, one of which was at the end of treatment, is declared a ‘cured’ patient.
Treatment and Management of TB
• Diagnosis of TB is done through X-ray, sputum examination.
• All patients who have TB need to be treated with anti-TB drugs which can 
take up to six or nine months. 
• The current approach is through Directly Observed Treatment, Short 
Course (DOTS).
• Patients must take the drugs regularly and not stop before the specified 
period even if they feel better.
Prevention of TB
• BCG vaccination of children can prevent TB 
among small children. BCG is given at birth.
• Finding cases and ensuring compliance with 
treatment is important.
• Improve living conditions. • ASHA should discuss TB during health 
communication sessions
• ASHA should encourage old people and 
those who are vulnerable with cough for 
over one month to visit a doctor.
• ASHA could serve as a DOTS provider in her village and ensure 
compliance with treatment. "
Skills That Save Lives ASHA Module-7 English,65,"Part D
Introduction to Infectious Diseases
 65Your Role in the Treatment Phase 
• You could serve as the DOTS provider in your village 
and ensure compliance. 
• Since the treatment is of long duration, the ASHA has 
a key role in motivating the patient to complete the 
treatment and prevent them from stopping midway or drop out. 
• Recognising the side-effects of the drugs (Annexe 8) 
and knowing how to deal with side-effects of drugs and making sure of drug availability at the health facility will help you to do this more effectively. 
• Encourage the patient to take sufficient nutrition 
during treatment and moderate rest at least for the first two months.
• The family of the patient should be counselled to take precautions at 
home especially for children and elder persons who can contract the disease quickly.
• The patient must eat and drink from a separate set of utensils which 
should be washed separately. When coughing, the patient must put a protective clean cloth over his mouth to prevent spread of droplets or leave the house and cough in a nearby open space. The cloth should be washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis. 
• The patient should not have close contact with spouse, children and 
infants and the elderly within the family at least for two months after starting treatment. Simple hygiene precautions will help in preventing transmission of TB within the family.
• You must keep a watch on the other family members to detect early signs 
of TB in the members and if necessary, get them examined from time to time.
• Ensure BCG vaccination of children at birth. This can help prevent TB 
among small children.
• TB is also a stigmatising disease. Confidentiality of patient identity must 
be maintained. 
• Awareness of TB related symptoms and the approach to achieving a cure 
through self-reporting for examination must be stressed at community gatherings as also the importance of good nutrition and taking of complete treatment.

66• Relapse of TB in patients who have had previous treatment is possible. 
Many times, such patients are considered as new patients. The record of 
previous treatment should be made known to the health facility where the patient presents for re-treatment so that a different drug regimen may be prescribed.
Precautions for Anti-TB Treatment among Pregnant Women
• Women in child bearing age should be counselled to avoid pregnancy 
while on anti-TB treatment and at least six months after.
• The effect of oral contraceptives is reduced by medicines and hence, other 
methods of contraception should be advocated.
• One of the TB drugs, Streptomycin, should not be given in the first 
trimester of pregnancy."

• Check that the test kit is within its expiry date. If not discard it. Read 
the instructions of the test kit, as there may be minor variations in the 
procedure between different kits. Place a small box, jar or bottle for trash next to the kit. 
• Open a foil pouch and check that the desiccant inside it is still blue. If not, 
discard the test.
• Remove the test strip and the small glass tube or loop from the foil pouch 
and place them on a clean dry surface.
• Take out the buffer solution and the dropper. Place a new test tube in the 
multiple well plate.
• Clean a finger with the swab and let the skin dry completely in the air. 
Prick finger on the side with a lancet. Place lancet in trash container. Let a drop of blood come out on the skin. 
• Touch the tip of the glass tube or the loop to the blood drop on the finger 
and let a small quantity of blood (a small drop) come up in the tube or the loop.
• Touch the tube or the loop to the test strip just below the arrow mark to 
place the blood there. If there is a paper, where Plasmodium falciparum is written, remove it and place the blood, where it was. Place tube/loop in trash container.
• Using the dropper, place 4 drops of buffer solution into a new test tube. 
After this, place the test strip containing blood in the buffer solution with the arrow pointing down. While waiting, a slide can be prepared. Materials in the Rapid Diagnostic Test Kit

2Preamble
With the National Health Policy of 2017, India took a giant step towards a Healthier India.
Health is defined as “a state of complete physical, social and mental well-being and not merely the absence of 
disease or infirmity.”
The conventional health care system concentrates on prevention, diagnosis and cure of diseases. Unfortunately, 
this often leaves suffering unattended. It is estimated that at least 10 million Indians are in serious health-related 
suffering every year.
The suffering can be because of pain and other symptoms or because of social, mental or spiritual issues.  
Palliative care addresses serious health related suffering in all these domains. Understandably, dealing with these 
necessitates multi-disciplinary teamwork. There is something for everyone to do including the patient and family, 
the community around them and all participants in health care delivery.
If we are to prevent and treat suffering, the application of palliative care has to happen all through the course of 
the disease from the time the suffering starts, which can even be before the time of diagnosis. Wherever disease-
specific treatment is being given, it has to go hand-in-hand with palliative care.
And palliative care is not only for the patient but also for the family, and therefore even when the patient dies, 
psycho-social support may have to be continued for the bereaved family.
This training program is aimed at empowering every health care provider to be a partner in reducing health related 
suffering in our country."

4Introduction to the module
India is currently in phase of epidemiological transition and has to deal with the double burden of Communicable 
and Non-Communicable diseases [NCD]. Currently NCDs contribute to about 2/3rd of mortality in our country. 
However, the public health system of our country is predominantly directed towards dealing with the communicable 
diseases. This changing health scenario has been recognized by the National Health Policy-2017. The policy 
envisages to “Improve health status through concerted policy action in all sectors and expand preventive, 
promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services provided through the public health sector with focus on 
quality”. This was further emphasized in the concept of comprehensive primary health care in the Ayushman 
Bharat Yojana. The expanded list services related to NCDs and Palliative Care will be provided through the Health 
and Wellness Centres [HWC].
Palliative care is required for patients with a wide range of life-limiting health problems. The majority of adults 
in need of palliative care have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (38.5%), cancer (34%), chronic 
respiratory diseases (10.3%), AIDS (5.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). Patients with many other conditions may require 
palliative care, including kidney failure, chronic liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, 
congenital anomalies and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
ASHA & Multipurpose Health Worker (Female/Male) have been recognized as the frontline workers for community 
outreach activities of Health & Wellness Centre. The addition of palliative care as part of comprehensive primary 
health care represents the inclusion of a new sub-population group into the activities of the HWC. This requires 
orientation, sensitization and learning from experiences with implementation across states. To ensure that the 
training of ASHA is in alignment of the expected role, following set of competencies have been identified."

Activity 1:
Ms. Savitri is a 32-year-old lady with advanced breast cancer in your neighbourhood. She has 
two children aged 8 and 6. Her husband is a manual labourer. The treating doctor has told 
the husband that her disease is not responding to treatment and the patient is likely to die in 
6–9 months. You visited her yesterday. She complained of pain all over the body. She looked 
very worried. As a neighbour, what can you do to help this patient and her family? Who all 
can you seek help from?
Adapted from: Palliative Care- A workbook for Carers, Institute of Palliative Medicine, Calicut.
What is Palliative Care?
 ∙Palliative care is the total, active care of patients suffering from life limiting illnesses along with care of the 
family. It relieves suffering and improves the quality of both life and death.
 ∙Palliativecare:
 -Respects life but also regards death as a normal process
 -Does not quicken or postpone death
 -Provides relief from pain and other difficult symptoms
 -Looks after the psychological and spiritual issues
 -Helps the patients live as actively as possible until death
 -Helps the family during the patient’s illness and after the death
 Chapter 1: Introduction to Palliative Care
History of Palliative care in India
 ∙In the olden days, in India, there were places built where the dying was cared for, like in Varanasi. In the 
west, the Christian missionaries took care of the old and dying in institutions called ‘hospices’.
 ∙The modern scientific palliative care was started by Dame Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom, from 
where it spread to other parts of theworld. 
 ∙Palliative care units in started in 1980s. Most of the palliative care centres in India are located in the 
South, especially Kerala where community involvement has been the outstanding factor. "

National Programme for Palliative Care was launched in India in 2012. National Health Policy [2017] also 
recognizes palliative care as an integral part of comprehensive primary health care.

Programme for Palliative Care
Who needs palliative care?
Those with:
 ∙Cancer
 ∙HIV/AIDS
 ∙Organ failures like heart failure, lung failure or kidney failure
 ∙Chronic neurological diseases eg - Parkinson’s disease, Stroke
 ∙Stroke or spinal cordinjuries
 ∙Old age conditions like Alzheimer’s disease etc.
 ∙Children with cerebral palsy or birth defects etc.
The principles of palliative care [Figure 2]:
 ∙Patient & Family is at the centre of the care
 ∙Palliative care looks at the person as a whole.
 ∙It takes care of the physical as well as emotional, social and spiritual needs of the patient and the family.
 ∙When a patient is suffering, the whole family suffers with him so it looks after the patient as well as the family.

What is the need for Palliative Care?
 ∙Out of the need 7 million people who die every year, almost 4 million need palliative care but less than 1% 
are able to access it
 ∙With changing lifestyle, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are becoming more common. NCDs, earlier 
thought to be diseases of the rich, actually affect poor people more as the poor have unhealthy living conditions, 
poor nutrition, more high-risk behaviour and cannot afford medicines and hospitals. All this leads to more 
psychosocial problems.
 ∙Most people pay for treatment out of their own pocket which pushes millions into poverty every year.
 ∙Patients with chronic diseases need not only medical treatment but regular support from their community. 
Current health care system is mostly meant for care of acute, not chronic illnesses. It is only the community 
that can support these needs.
 ∙With more people living in cities and joint families becoming less common, the traditional social support is 
no longer available, adding to the difficulty.
Who are the members of Palliative Care Team?
 ∙Palliative care requires a team approach. It requires various specialists working with palliative care physicians, 
nurses, social workers, spiritual care guides, community health workers, physio therapists as well as the 
patient’s family. Community based volunteers, health workers are very important members of this team.
Where are palliative Care Services provided?
 ∙Palliative care can be given any where - at home, in the hospital or in a place for the terminally sick which is 
called a ‘hospice’.

 ∙In India, home care is considered better because patients are more comfortable in their own home. It is 
cheaper and the family can take care without having to travel or lose out on employment.
 ∙Palliative care can be provided at small primary health centres, secondary level hospitals or the referral 
hospitals, along with the patient’s regular treatment.
 ∙It should be a part of existing health care at all levels of care. Low cost, effective palliative care can be delivered 
as part of primary care even in far-offareas.
 ∙Most of the palliative care is required in the community and can be provided in villages by training doctors, 
nurses, community health workers, volunteers and family members. Some patients with difficult symptoms 
may need to be referred for specialist palliative care.
When to initiate Palliative Care Services?
 ¾To yield best results, palliative care should be started early, preferably from the time of diagnosis.
 ¾This helps build trust, plan ahead to prevent symptoms and have timely discussions with thefamily
 ¾It helps plan for good end of life care by making wise, well-informed and timely decisions when the disease is 
advanced."

3.1: Pain 
Definition of Pain:
 ¾“Pain is an unpleasant experience because of actual or likely damage to tissues. It is subjective and varies from 
person to person. It is both a physical and an emotional.
What are the dimensions of Pain?
 ¾It has three dimensions- physical, psychosocial and spiritual. This concept is called – ‘Total pain’. Without 
taking care of each part, we cannot treat pain properly.
Figure 6: Dimensions of pain
What are acute and chronic pain?
 ¾Acute pain like that of injury and surgery causes patients to cry with pain or roll around. It decreases with 
time as healing takes place. It is treated with tablets or injections when needed.
 ¾Any pain that lasts more than three months is called chronic pain. Chronic pain causes permanent changes 
in the nerves, so the treatment is different from that of acute pain.Chapter 3: Management of symptoms
Three dimensions 
of PainPhysical
Psychosocial
Spiritual"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,15,"15
15
 ¾Chronic pain however, does not decrease with time. It increases as the disease advances. However, the 
patient may not cry or even look like he is in pain. He becomes quiet, with drawn, loses appetite and sleep 
and may lie quietly in a corner, not talking to any one.
 ¾ A combination of medicines may be needed. As the disease advances, the patient may need increased doses 
or more medicines. This does not mean that he has become addicted.
What are the non-pharmacological (non-drug) methods to manage symptoms?
These are non-drug methods to help control pain 
 ¾Physiotherapy, hot and cold packs and massage
 ¾Proper positioning, reassurance, diversion therapy, art or music therapy, acupressure and acupuncture can 
help.
3.2: Breathlessness
 ¾Breathlessness occurs in almost half of the patients referred for palliative care. It can be very frightening. It 
restricts activities. There is loss of independence, frustration, anger and depression. Breathlessness at rest 
can cause anxiety and panic attacks. Patients often fear suffocating to death. Explanation and support are 
important.
 ¾Management:
1. Oxygen: may help in few cases where there is less oxygen in the blood but in cases where the lungs are 
destroyed by the disease, it may not help.
2. Non-pharmacological (non-drug) treatment-This is very important treatment modality, and the family 
should be taught about this. These include:
 ∙Propping up with pillows or cushions
 ∙Putting a fan near the patient to direct a stream of air over the face
 ∙Good ventilation by keeping doors and windows open
 ∙Placing the patient near an open window
 ∙Calm environment
 ∙Loose, comfortable clothes
 ∙Wiping the face with a wet towel
 ∙Rubbing the back
 ∙Relaxation techniques - asking the patient to think about something pleasant eg. a favourite holiday 
spot, happy memories, favourite songs, thinking about a calm scene like a sea shore/mountain etc.
 ∙Physio therapy in the form of deep breathing, leaning forward and pursed lip breathing
 ∙Talking to the patient in a calm and soothing voice
 ∙Discussing their fears openly
 ∙The family should keep calm and not panic because anxiety spreads quickly from one member to 
another"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,16,"16
16Figure 7: Non pharma cological management of breathlessness
 ¾Breathlessness in a dying patient-Patients often fear suffocating to death. No patient should die with distressing 
breathlessness. There are medicines which can help prevent and treat breathlessness in the dying. It is good 
to plan for future steps in case the patient has advanced illness. The family should be advised on emergency 
medicines available with help from the palliative team. Call or refer to the doctor for advice.
3.3: Nausea and Vomiting
 ¾Nausea is an unpleasant feeling of the need to vomit and vomiting is the forceful throwing out of stomach 
contents through the mouth. Nausea causes more misery than vomiting.
 ¾Management
 ∙Non-pharmacological (non-drug) management:
 ∙A calm, reassuring environment away from the sight and smell of food
 ∙Avoid exposure to foods, which precipitate nausea
 ∙Small frequent meal
 ∙Cold food is tolerated better than hot food
 ∙Control of bad smell from wound
3.4: Constipation
 ¾Constipation is the difficult or painful passing of stools, less number of stools which are hard. About 45% of 
palliative care patients are constipated. It can cause bloating and rectal fullness, loss of appetite, abdominal 
pain, bowel obstruction, over flow diarrhoea and urinary retention. Causes of constipation include:
 ∙Immobility leading to decreased peristalsis
 ∙Decreased food intake, low fibre diet
NON PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF  
BREATHLESSNESS"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,17,"17
17
 ∙Poor fluid intake or increased fluid loss (vomiting, diarrhoea)
 ∙Inability to raise intra-abdominal pressure (general weakness, paraplegia)
 ∙Inability to reach toilet on time
 ∙Opioids (90% of patients taking opioids need laxatives)
 ∙Embarrassment in public place
 ∙Pain (fissure in anal area)
 ¾Management
Non-pharmacological (non-drug) management:
 ∙Being able to get to the toilet may be more important than laxatives
 ∙Timing and privacy
 ∙Straining damages pelvic muscles
 ∙A squatting position helps
 ∙As far as possible patients should be encouraged to eat a normal balanced diet and drink plenty of fluid, 
but this may not be possible in palliative care patients
For Drug management for severe constipation – Consult the doctor
3.5: Diarrhea
 ¾Diarrhea is defined as the passage of three or more loose stools in 24 hours. Patients can understand 
“diarrhea” in different ways so always clarify. Diarrhea is less common than constipation in patients requiring 
palliative care.
 ¾General Measures
 ∙Increase fluid intake-frequent sipping of water / Home-made ORS / Dal water / Lemon water/ Coconut 
water 
 ∙Reassurance that most diarrhoea is self-limiting
For specific drug treatment - consult the doctor

4.1: Care of the bed ridden patient
Nursing care of bed ridden patients is quite challenging. Patient may be conscious or unconscious.
In a bed ridden patient, the care includes:
 ∙Health education of the family
 ∙Involving the family in the care
 ∙Demonstrate the care and make a follow up plan
 ∙Regular home visits
 ∙Airway clearance
 ∙Adequate fluid intake (oral, naso gastric tube feeding)
 ∙Bowel and bladder care

4.1.1: Care of hair and how to give head bath
Stimulating the scalp by massage and brushing improves circulation and keeps hair healthy
Purpose:
 ∙To keep the hair clean and healthy
 ∙To promote the growth of hairChapter 4: Basic Nursing Skills"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,19,"19

 ∙To prevent loss of hair
 ∙To prevent itching and infection
 ∙To prevent accumulation of oil, dirt and dandruff
 ∙To prevent hair tangles
 ∙To provide a sense of well-being
 ∙To stimulate circulation
 ∙To destroy lice
 ∙To appear well groomed
Points to remember while giving bed bath
 ∙Protect the bed linen and pillow cover with a towel and mackintosh [rubber/plastic sheet]
 ∙Place a mackintosh under the patient’s head and neck. Keep one end of the mackintosh in a bucket to receive 
the water. Wash thoroughly with soap or shampoo
 ∙Rinse thoroughly and dry the hair. Braid the hair into two on each side of the head, behind the ears to make 
the patient more comfortable when lying on herback
 ∙Patients may be advised short clipping of hair if it’s acceptable.
4.1.2:  Care of eyes
 ∙The most common problem of the eyes is secretions that dry on the lashes. This may need to be softened 
and wiped away
 ∙Each eye is cleaned from the inner to the outer corner with separate swabs 3 or 4 times daily with boiled, 
cooled water
4.1.3: Care of nose and ears
 ∙Excessive collection of secretions makes the patient sniff and blow the nose. External crusted secretions 
can be removed with a wet cloth or a cotton applicator moistened with oil, normal saline or water. Dirt may 
accumulate behind the ears and in the front part of the ear.
 ∙ Another common problem is the collection of ear wax which can be removed and if not refer, to ENT surgeon.
4.1.4: Mouthcare
 ∙If the patient is conscious, help the patient in his/her mouth care. If the patient is unconscious, the care givers 
need to be taught mouth care by demonstrating the procedure.
 ∙ Solutions which can be used are - Normal Saline, neem leaves boiled in water, tooth brush and tooth paste. 
Daily assessment is recommended. Brush and rinse mouth twice daily or according to the patient’s condition. 
Soak dentures overnight. Apply lip balm for cracked lips.
4.2: Care of dependent patients:
 ∙Two or Four hourly mouth care (assess individually)
 ∙Use of soft brush, foam sticks applicator or glove and gauze
 ∙Use of syringe for gentle mouth wash
 ∙Avoid lemon and glycerin as it causes dry mouth"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,20,"20
204.2.1: Assisted oralcare
 ∙Explain the procedure to the patients and help them
 ∙Assemble the things needed for mouth care that is toothbrush, toothpaste, small basin, water in a jug, towel, 
lip lubricant
 ∙Put him on side lying position with a towel below the cheek
 ∙Cut short the bristles of the toothbrush and wrap with the gauze or sterile cotton cloth
 ∙One tsp of salt in 500 ml of water and boiled
 ∙Remove all the water from the mouth to prevent aspiration
4.2.2: Bed bath
Bathing is very important in maintaining and promoting hygiene. It helps:
 ∙To clean the dirt from the body
 ∙To increase elimination of wastes through the skin
 ∙To prevent pressure sores
 ∙To stimulate circulation
 ∙To induce sleep
 ∙To provide comfort
 ∙To relieve fatigue
 ∙To give the patient a sense of well-being
 ∙To regulate body temperature
 ∙To provide active and passive exercises
General instructions for bed bath
 ∙Maintain privacy
 ∙Explain the procedure
 ∙Patient’s room should be warm and free of draughts
 ∙All needed equipment should be at hand and conveniently placed
 ∙Avoid giving unnecessary exertion to the patient
 ∙Remove the soap completely from the body to avoid the drying effect
 ∙Only small area of the body should be exposed and bathed at a time
 ∙Support should be given to the joints while lifting the arms and legs during cleaning and drying of these areas
 ∙Provide active and passive exercises whenever possible unless contraindicated
 ∙Wash the hands and feet by immersing them in a basin of water because it promotes thorough cleaning of 
the finger nails and toe nails
 ∙Cut short the nails, if they are long"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,21,"21
21
 ∙A thorough inspection of the skin especially at the back of the body should be done to find out the early signs 
of pressure sore
 ∙All the skin surfaces should be included in the bathing process with special care in cleaning and drying the 
creases and folds and the bony prominences, as these parts are most likely to be injured
 ∙Cleaning is done from the cleanest area to the less clean area, e.g. upper parts of the body should be cleaned 
before the lower parts
 ∙The temperature of the water should be adjusted for the comfort of the patient
 ∙Creams/oils/paraffin are used to prevent drying and excoriation of the skin
 ∙Keep the patient near the edge of the bed to avoid over reaching and straining of the back of the care giver
4.2.3: Backcare
 ∙Patients, who are prone to pressure sores, must have their back care every 2 hours or more frequently
 ∙Wash the back with soap and water, dried and massaged with any available lubricant to prevent friction
 ∙Massaging helps to increase the blood supply to the area and prevent pressure sore
 ∙Give special attention to the pressure points
 ∙Dry the area by patting and not by rubbing
 ∙Stroke with both hands on the back
4.2.4: Active and passive exercise
Exercise must be integrated into the patient’s daily life as it prevents contractures, foot drop and wrist drop. All 
the joints need physiotherapy. Educate the family the importance of exercise to prevent joint stiff ness. If there is 
no restriction or bone problems exercise can be given by the patient’s family.
4.2.5: Care of perineum
Perineum should be cleaned after each act of urination and defection. Clean with soap and water daily 3 to 4 
times and keep the area dry. Clean from the cleanest to the less clean area. The urethral orifice is considered as 
the cleanest area and the anal orifice is considered as the least clean area. Hands should be cleaned after giving 
perineal care.
4.2.6: Pressuresores
A pressure sore or pressure ulcer is an injury to the skin and tissue under neath, usually caused by unrelieved 
pressure. Pressure on a small area of the body can compress tiny blood vessels that normally supply tissue with 
oxygen and nutrients resulting in in sufficient blood flow and necrosis of the area.
Stages of pressure sores
1. Erythema: Skin is intact but red and does not turn white when pressure is applied
2. Breakdown of the dermis: Outer layer of the skin is broken, red and painful
3. Full thickness skin breakdown: This involves damage or necrosis of sub cutaneous tissues
4. Breakdown of bone, muscle and supporting tissues: This involves deep wounds that are difficult to heal"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,22,"22
22Purpose of care
With proper treatment, most pressure sores will heal. Healing depends on many things, general health and diet, 
relieving pressure on the sore and careful cleaning and dressing.

Measures to prevent pressure sores are provided in the diagram below: 
 
Figure 9: Preventive measures for Pressure ulcers, Source: Palliative Care- A  Work Book for Carers, 
Institute of Palliative Medicine, Calicut.
Pressure sore care
 ∙Use normal saline for cleaning and irrigating the wound
 ∙Remove dead tissues and scab
 ∙Use moist dressing material; this prevents damaging granulation tissue while changing the dressing
Points to remember
 ∙Maintain daily hygiene with sponge bath, shower, hair care, and shave, trim nails
 ∙Maintain hygienic environment, such as clean clothing, and bedlinen
 ∙Assess skin integrity, especially pressure points, 
 ∙Patient with poor mobility need change of position every 2-4 hours
 ∙Positioning of pillows
 ∙Massage (attention must be paid to avoid since massage can cause tissue damage at pressure points)
 ∙Pad bony prominences for protection
 ∙Use water bed or air mattress
 ∙Education of family about care procedures
4.2.7: Bowel Care
Constipation is more common than diarrhoea. Carefully assess bowel function on daily basis. Take a detailed 
history. Passage of hard stools is difficult and painful. Always compare with the patient’s normal bowel habit. Find 
out whether he/she is regularly taking laxatives. If a record of bowel habits is maintained, it will help in proper 
bowel management. Prevention is the key.
If a cause is identified for constipation, remove if possible. Regular exercise reduces the risk of constipation. 
Encourage deep breathing, abdominal massage etc. Encourage intake of fibre rich diet and fluids.Make sure your patients gets pressure relief on proper supporting 
surfaces.
Regular skin inspection required over all body prominences and 
at risk areas. Care givers must be able to pick the earliest signs of 
pressure injury.
Do proper positioning & frequent posture change.  
Encourage patient mobility.
Bladder & bowel care. Catheterize bladder if needed. Frequent 
change of dressings and diapers to loop patients clean and dry.
Nutrition & hydration. Patients must have right diet and fluid 
intake.Supporting

24Prevention:
 ∙Simple measures should be incorporated as part of the routine plan in all patients.
 ∙Maintain good symptom control.
 ∙Mobility: Activity is the key stimulus to colonic peristalsis and defecation. Mobility should be encouraged as 
much aspossible.
 ∙Maintain adequate oral fluid intake.
 ∙Use of bed pans: It is mandatory to maintain patients’ privacy and use of a commode or lavatory for defecation.
4.2.8 Bed Making
Purpose
 ∙To provide comfort for patients whose physical conditions confines them to bed and for patients on imposed 
bed rest for the therapeutic  reasons
 ∙To change wet/soiled linen for the bed ridden patients
 ∙To maintain neat appearance and clean environment
 ∙To provide a smooth wrinkle free bed foundation thus minimizing sources of skin irritation
Procedure
 ∙Wash hands
 ∙Remove extra pillows
 ∙Loosen the top bedding from head end to foot end. Remove blanket leaving the top sheet over the patient.
 ∙Position the patient on side on the far side of the bed facing away. Adjust the pillow under the head.
 ∙Loosen bottom linen from head end to foot end on both sides
 ∙Clean and roll the mackintosh towards the patient
 ∙Fan fold the bottom sheet towards the patient and push it as close to the patient as possible
 ∙Dust the mattress with dry duster
 ∙Apply clean bottom linen, which is fan folded length wise to the exposed half of the bed, keeping the center 
fold in the center of the bed
 ∙Fan-fold the bottom sheet towards the patient. Smoothen the bottom layer over the mattress and bring the 
edge over near side. Allow the sheets to hang about 25 cm over mattress edge, make mitered corner at the 
head end of the bed. Tuck the hanging sheets on the sides till the foot end. The lower hem of the bottom 
should be even with the bottom edge of mattress."

Introduction
 ¾End of life P alliative Care patients are mostly bed ridden and cannot come to an OPD of a hospital. Such 
patients will need to be cared for at a hospice or their homes. Since most of our patients prefer to be cared 
at homes, home care palliative care services should be provided.
 ¾Home based palliative care has several additional advantages for the patient and family such as comfort, 
privacy, familiarity with surroundings, security, autonomy and a greater degree of independence. 
 ¾It is also cost effective and as it does not entail travelling to the hospital repeatedly for follow up visits and 
unnecessary investigations and treatments. 
 ¾Some additional advantages of home care include:
1. Easy access to care: The patient and family have access to advice and to all aspects of palliative care 
(physical, psychological, social and spiritual) at their doorstep.
2.  More effective caring: Advice, training and additional support for the family is available so that they can 
become more effective in their role as care givers and feel abler to manage and cope.
3. Access to complementary services: The home care team can facilitate liaison with complementary and 
supportive services when required. The patient and family do not have to go out seeking such support 
on their own.
4. Maintains confidentiality: This is especially important for people with Cancer & HIV/AIDS who may 
otherwise be shunned by the community out of ignorance and due to misconceptions about the disease.
5. Spreading awareness in the community: Wherever appropriate, home care programmes can be used to 
spread awareness about palliative care. It is often the case that when a family is nursing someone with 
cancer their friends and associates become more aware and are more willing to discuss issues around 
terminal care. The family being cared for, too, can become ambassadors for the cause.Chapter 5: Home Care"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,27,"27
27
6. Mobilizing local resources:  Local support groups and volunteers can be mobilized to support patients and 
care givers living in their particular area. They would be more willing to do this not only because they may 
know or have personal ties with the people affected but because it is much easier for neighbours to help 
each other than travel long distances to do so.
 ¾Home care thus provide an avenue where palliative care can be practiced in all its domains [Physical, Social, 
Psychological, Spiritual] most effectively. 
 ¾The aim is to address “Total Pain” of patients and their Care Givers and improve the quality of life of the 
patients and their relatives.
What is the composition of a Home Care Team?
 ¾The Home Care Team consists of professionals trained in Palliative Care namely a Medical officer, a community 
Health Officer, a Nurse, Multipurpose Health Worker (Female/Male), community volunteer. All the member of 
the team need not be available for all the visits. The composition of team can be decided based on the type 
of patients during the visit. The visit would be arranged and co-ordinated by ASHA.  
How Does a Home Care Function? 
 ¾Each team caters for an area served by the Sub Health Centre - Health and Wellness Centre or Primary Health 
Centre - Health and Wellness Centre. 
 ¾ASHA will identify bed-ridden patients and others needing palliative care be offered home care visit. This is 
followed by visits by MPW/CHO for further assessment using Palliative care screening tool
 ¾The first visit to the patient’s home takes 2 Hours. The Palliative Care issues of the patient and the family are 
identified (Medical, Nursing and counseling). Urgent issues are addressed during the first visit. 
 ¾The patients are categorized into High, Middle and low priorities depending on their Palliative Care needs. 
The High priority patients are visited once/twice or more often every week. Middle priority patients are 
visited once a fortnight. Low priority patients are visited once a month. These priorities are changed as and 
when required. 
What are the scope of services in home care?
The services that can be provided as part of home care vary from setting to setting. Following services are 
generally included as part of home care.

Universal precautions
Introduction
Faced with concerns about the spread of serious infections, hospitals and health centers have begun using a 
successful technique that is also appropriate in many other settings. Rather than waiting to find out who is 
contagious, they treat everyone as a potentially infected person. The name of this infection control method is 
“universal precautions”; and it gives a set of guidelines to follow when you come into contact with body fluids and 
wastes that carry germs. It is not a lot of extra work and it really pays off. Health Care Workers who might come 
into contact with blood and other body fluids to practice the following infection control practices at all times with 
everyone:  
 ¾Hand washing
 ¾Use of Personal Protective Equipment [eg. latex gloves]
 ¾Cleaning and disinfecting of contaminated areas/instruments
 ¾Proper disposal of waste materials
The concept of Universal Health Care Precautions emphasizes that all our patients should be treated as though 
they have potential blood/ body fluid borne infections and can infect the caring health care workers. 
1. Hand washing
 ¾Hand washing is the most important infection control measure to prevent illness
 ¾The amount of illness can be drastically reduced, if hands are washed at proper times and with the proper 
techniques.
 ¾Hands should be washed with soap for at least 30 seconds, rinse them thoroughly and dry thoroughly.
 ¾Hand washing should occur immediately before and after any patient care activities
 
Figure 13: Steps of handwashing

2. Personal Protective Equipment [PPE]
 ¾Personal protective equipment, is “specialized clothing or equipment, worn by an employee for protection 
against infectious materials.” The items include gowns, gloves, masks, respirators, cap, face shield and 
goggles. Suitable PPE should be used as per the guidance of Medical Officer or Nurse.
3. Cleaning and disinfecting of contaminated areas/instruments
 ¾Wear gloves and use disposable towels or other means of cleaning that will ensure against direct contact 
with blood, body fluids or feces. 
 ¾Decontaminate the area with an approved germicide or 1:100 solution of household bleach 1% sodium 
hypochlorite.
 ¾All used equipment must be thoroughly washed and disinfected.
4. Bio medical waste management
 ¾All the waste generated during home care should be handled as per the Bio Medical Waste Management 
Rules 2016. 
Figure 14: Bio Medical Waste Category and colour codes

30 ¾The following steps are suggested while visiting people at home:
 ∙Know the patient and family well. Even if you know them, cross check before hand the names, the disease 
and socio-cultural status
 ∙If on a follow-up visit, check the problems they had, the management planned and anything that the care 
team had to take care of
 ∙Address the patient and family respectfully
 ∙Introduce your self and the team members
 ∙Explain the purpose of the visit
 ∙Try to start a friendly conversation
 ∙If there are forms to fill, it can be done later during the visit
 ∙Listen actively
 ∙Ask about social, emotional, financial and spiritual problems. You may start from the most distressing issue 
and move on to the others
 ∙The patient and family may not share all their feelings during the first visit but may do so later. If they do 
not want or are un comfortable discussing a certain topic, do not force them. You can discuss these issues 
later when a good rapport is built
 ∙Allow them to ask questions. If you are not very sure about the answers, say so. You may discuss with 
others before answering
 ∙Discuss with appropriate persons and experts in the team if needed. Clearly explain the management plan 
to the patient and the care giver
 ∙Do the necessary and appropriate interventions
 ∙Document your visit, the information gathered and the procedure done
 ∙An abridged version of the initial assessment format which can be used for documenting the follow up 
visits is annexed. [Annexure 4]
 ∙Plan further follow-up if required and date for next visit. Communicate this to the patient and family"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,31,"31

Competency: Demonstrates an understanding and application of the principles of good communication in 
palliative care
Specific Learning Objectives
 ∙List Do’s and Don’ts when dealing with psychologically disturbed patient/family
 ∙Describe the protocol for handling an emotionally disturbed individual
 ∙Demonstrate the principles for handling difficult questions
Activity 3:
During the visit by the home care team, it was observed that Ms. Savitri was very anxious and distressed. She 
was crying repeatedly. She asked the Nurse, why did she develop this condition? She also expressed worries 
about her family
Discuss in small group 
 ∙How would you plan a communication session with Ms. Savitri?
 ∙How would you like to include Savitri’s children in the entire discussion?
Share in the large group
As a ASHA, you will be meeting patients and their families with the intention of assessing their needs and 
referring them on to other sources of support. However, there is a great deal that you can do on your own to 
assist a patient who may be struggling with psychosocial and spiritual issues because of a debilitating and life 
limiting illness. This is known as empathic communication.
The most valuable thing you have to offer someone else is YOU. Being consciously aware of your own behaviour, 
what you say and do, and how you conduct yourself, makes the contact with the patient and family. Remember, 
what the person you visit will remember most clearly is you, not what you did or said.
Therefore, before anything else, you need to reflect on what kind of beliefs and prejudices you have that may 
facilitate or impede the process of rapport building.
When people get sicker and approach the end of their life’s journey, there is often a great deal of spiritual 
suffering. Each person needs to come to terms with their own losses in their own way. We are there to walk with 
them in that journey, not to tell them what to think, feel or believe. It is therefore important that we don’t try and 
take the suffering away by trying to impose our own spiritual solutions onto their spiritual struggles. 
Key points to remember:
 ∙Psychosocial and spiritual needs of patients and caregivers
 ∙Each one of us deals with a chronic, life altering and debilitating illness, as well as with the possibility of dying, 
in our own unique way. Our age and level of maturity, our socio-economic status, our personality, all play a 
role. However, based on numerous studies and observations, the following emotions have been identified as 
most likely to influence the behaviour of a sick person:Chapter 6 : Psychosocial and Spiritual Support in Palliative 
Care"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,32,"32
32 -Anger (Why me?)
 -Fear (What will happen to me?)
 -Loss (I have lost everything that gave my life value)
 -Guilt/Blame (I should have gone earlier to the doctor/I did not have the moneyto see a proper doctor)
 -Shame (How will people now treat me and my family?)
 -Grief/Despair (This will only get worse and end in suffering and death)
 -Hope (I shall remain pain free and continue to function independently)
These emotions are a result of the difficult circumstances that people find themselves in which rob them of their 
previous sense of normalcy and security. They may also test and alter relationships within the family and with 
friends.
What are the needs of the patient? 
 ∙To participate in own illness
 ∙To be treated with respect
 ∙To be heard and to ventilate feelings
 ∙To continue to live with dignity
 ∙To resolve conflicts
 ∙To receive peace and forgiveness
 ∙To get permission to die
What are the needs of the family?
 ∙To be able to express feelings openly
 ∙To ask questions and receive honest answers
 ∙To get help to resolve family conflicts,etc.
 ∙To get reassurance and information
 ∙To receive affordable medical, nursing and emotional support
In the Indian situation, we are often faced with dilemmas based on our culture:
 ∙Who to communicate with?
 ∙What to communicate?
 ∙How to communicate?
 ∙When to communicate?
While there are no easy answers, as every situation and family differ, as a rule of thumb the following may be 
kept in mind:
 ∙Focus on patient and main decision maker
 ∙Gauge readiness of patient and family to accept the truth"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,33,"33
33
 ∙Give bad news in small doses. This allows the patient and family time to absorb the information being given.
 ∙Respect silence. Do not rush in. Wait for are sponse.
 ∙Do not answer direct questions such as, “When will I die?” or “How long do I have?” Instead, explore further. 
Ask a counter question like, “Why do you ask?” or “Is there anything in particular that you want to do?”
 ∙Do not neglect children as they are also part of the family dynamic.
Like anything else, listening needs to be practiced so that it becomes effortless. Here are a few useful tips:
 ∙Ask open-ended questions like “How are you feeling?” or ‘What is your concern?”
 ∙Reflect what is being said: “so what you are saying is that you feel very angry because…”
 ∙Clarify/Do not assume
Recognising and responding to psychosocial and spiritual distress
 ∙Main care give must do a psychosocial assessment of the patient. This will help identify psychological trauma 
as well as signs of depression. It will also bring to light spiritual distress because of unresolved family matters 
related to forgiveness, feeling that God has abandoned them, fear of punishment after death, etc.
The nature of the patient’smood:
“How exactly are you feeling?” -The severity
“How bad does it get?” - The frequency
“How often do you feel this way?” -The duration
“How long does it last?” -The triggers
“Is there anything that makes it worse?”- The impact
“How does this affect your day-to-day life?”
“How does it affect you?”
The same may be done for the main caregiver. 
After the assessment, one must deal with these issues as best one can or, depending on their severity, identify 
them and inform to ANM.
Dealing with emotional issues:
 ∙Most patients will have unfocused anger which may even be directed at you. The best way to deal with this is 
to listen without interruption. By the time they finish, they will be relieved of their anger and grateful to you 
for giving them the opportunity to express themselves.
 ∙Fear is another common emotion. If not openly expressed it will continue to grow. Patient’s often have 
unfounded fears that can be relieved through discussion. They should be encouraged to list their fears and 
prioritise them so that they can be dealt with one at a time. This makes fear more manageable.
There are patients who become uncommunicative and withdraw. Do not assume that they do not want to talk. 
Consider why they have withdrawn. Here are a few possibilities:
 ∙Fear
 ∙Embarrassment (perhaps due to disfigurement)"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,34,"34
34 ∙Depression (sense of worthless ness)
 ∙Confusion (feel rejected and lost)
 ∙Anger
 ∙Denial
 ∙Think no one is interested inthem
 ∙Suspicion/Lack of trust
 ∙Physical disability (for example have lost voice-box)
 ∙Very often after the death of a patient care givers feel guilty. They feel that they did not do enough: “If only 
I had had more money?” “If only I could have taken him or her to a particular hospital?” etc. The best way 
to deal with this is to ask the care giver to make a list of the things they did do for the patient. This will help 
them realise that they have done a great deal and make them less guilty.
 ∙Shame and stigma tend to be associated with diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. It is important to talk 
openly with the patient and the family and to answer all their questions.
 ∙Over time, a shift in attitude is likely to take place.
 ∙Never forget hope; it always has a place no matter what the prognosis. Our task is to foster it at all stages but not 
to give false hope. We must find out what the hopes of patients are by asking them. The same holds true for care 
givers. We may ask: “What is your hope for your loved one?” Usually what patients and care givers are looking 
for is more control over their situation so that they can move from a feeling of helplessness to one of hope.
Dealing with spiritual issues:
Patients who are dying often ask questions like: “How much time do I have?” “When will I die?” “What will 
happen to me after I die”, etc. It is best to help them explore their fears and respond with empathy rather than 
provide answers. This is not the occasion or time to inflict your own religious belief or personal point of view on 
the patient.
Patients often confide that they wish to go to God in peace. Often what they are asking for is helping to resolve 
some unfinished business. It could be need for forgiveness from a loved one, reconciling with an estranged relative, 
or reaching out to someone who has rejected them. It is a good practice to ask permission from the patient and 
the family before you reach out to the concerned person on their behalf.
There are patients who talk about ending their lives. As palliative care practitioners, we believe that this is a cry 
for help that can be met with the right medical, nursing, psychosocial and spiritual response. However, we should 
remain vigilant to suicidal tendencies, to clinical depression and to mental illnesses that may predispose patients 
to take this extreme step.
We must direct them to the appropriate consultant.
This holds true for the bereavement phase too. There may be care givers who are finding it difficult to cope with 
loss and grief after the death of a loved one. This may be compounded by poverty, especially if the person who 
died was the main bread-earner. While grief is natural we should be able to recognise grief that refuses to resolve. 
Parents often find it difficult to accept the death of a child. Care givers may also have their own set of spiritual 
questions at this stage: “How is my loved one?” “Where is he or she now?” “How could God allow this?” ‘Will I 
see them again when I die?” Once again, it is not the answers we give that matter as much as how comfortable 
people are to discuss their deepest feelings with us and thereby find inner peace."

Important points
1. Palliative Care is incomplete unless we address psychological and spiritual issues of patients and their care 
givers.
2. Often our attitudes and biases stand in the way of us becoming effective healers. Self-reflection must go hand 
in hand with the acquisition of knowledge and skill.
3. By using the technique of empathic listening, we can encourage people to express their emotions and share 
their anxieties which will help them cope better.
4. Empathic communication requires hard work and practice. It is about:
 ∙ Relationship building
 ∙ Observation of the patient and family
 ∙ Identification of the main problem
 ∙ Formulation of goals
 ∙ Assessment and evaluation
 ∙ Referral where needed
5. As ASHA, we should be conscious of our limits and should be able to refer psychosocial and spiritual distress 
to the requisite specialist, whether it is a doctor or apriest."

Think about these questions independently 
Volunteer to share with the group if you feel comfortable.
End of life Care is the way of caring for a terminally ill patient that shifts attention to symptom control, 
comfort, dignity, quality of life and quality of dying instead of trying to cure or increase the life.
The terminal phase is when day to day worsening, particularly of strength, appetite and awareness is occurring.
Recognizing the terminal phase
Remember, these signs and symptoms are just relative, wide variations can occur, so it is not possible 
to predict accurately.
 ∙Increasing weakness, the patient becomes bed bound
 ∙Loss of interest in surroundings and food
 ∙Difficulty in swallowing
 ∙Drowsiness
 ∙Cool hands and feet

* Consider non-pharmacological methods
 -Switching on fan
 -Staying with the patient and boosting morale
 -Gently stroking the back
Anxiety, restlessness and confusion
* Look for causes like pain
* Noisy secretions (death rattle) are due to collected secretions at the back of the throat when patient is too

* The family can stay inside or wait outside as they wish
* Confirming death
 -Wash hands
 -Confirm identity ofpatient
 -Watch for signs of life like movement, breathing, twitching etc
 -Look for signs of efforts to breathe"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,39,"39

 -Document that a family member (name and relation) has been informed about the death
 -Inform the MPW/Community Health Officer/doctor/RMP/village Panchayat/BDO
Bereavement Support for the family
 ∙Palliative care does not stop with the patient’s death. It continues after the death of the patient in the form of 
bereavement support for the family.
 ∙After the death, pay a bereavement visit to the family.
 ∙Collect back any unused opioids and hand them to the palliative team.
 ∙The family may need support for a few months after death
 ∙People may grieve for six months to one year after death and then slowly resume normal life
 ∙Some people may find it very difficult to accept, especially the death of the earning member or a child and go 
into depression. They will need referral to a counselor or psychiatrist."

Activity 5:
Pool the details of government and non-government agencies in the area from which a patient/family can get 
medical/ social/financial support
Discuss in small group and share with the large group
Develop this into a sharable resource list for the area
Adapted from: Palliative Care- A workbook for the carers, Institute of Palliative Medicine, 
Calicut.
Role of Community in Palliative Care
People living with chronic illnesses and old age-related problems spend most of their time at home and they are 
in need of regular care for the rest of their lives. For most, death is preceded by a period of suffering for days, 
weeks, months or years. The main fears they have are fear of death and abandonment. Most prefer to be cared 
for in their homes and wish to die at home. There are enough resources available in any community to build a 
‘safety net’ around these patients.
Community Participation
Community is a group of people living together. Community participation is the involvement of people in a 
community to solve their own problems. Community participation can be of two types:
1. Helping through resources (money, manpower, time etc.)
2. Taking responsibility for identifying patients and caring for them
A Kerala based community based palliative care program called Neighbourhood Network in Palliative care (NNPC) 
is an example of a successful community owned palliative care program.Chapter 8 : Community Participation in Palliative Care"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,41,"41
41
Benefits of Community Participation
1. The patients and families get health services nearby
2. The community benefits through improving skills, confidence and empowerment.
3. Awareness and acceptability of palliative care
4. Positive outlook towards incurable diseases
5. It helps change social and cultural factors
6. It ensures that health services are accountable and provide good quality car
Community volunteers
A volunteer is someone who works for a community because they choose to do so. Volunteers are the backbone 
of a good community based palliative care program.
They can be:
1. Untrained Volunteers
They help in the social support system, e.g., food for patients, spending time with the patient, respite to the 
family, transport, educational support for children and working with the local government.
2. Trained Volunteers
Some of the motivated volunteers can undergo a formal training in palliative care and get involved in direct patient 
care, e.g., providing emotional support, basic nursing, help with mobility, managing medicines etc.
Role of community volunteers:
They can provide -
 ¾Emotional support
 ¾Basic nursing care
 ¾Linking up with the professional team
 ¾Social support through giving-
* Food for the family
* Educational support for children
* Helping with transport to hospital
* Linking with other support groups and benefits from government/NGOs
 ¾Rehabilitation
 ¾Community volunteers can take up responsibilities related to:
* Awareness programmes
* Training the family members to look after the patient
* Training volunteers
* Administration of the unit
* Fund raising"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,42,"42
42Role of family
Family and friends are very important in providing round-the-clock care to patients in their homes. The health 
care providers can empower the family by education and training so that they can look after the patients with 
help from the volunteers.
How to mobilise a community?
It means encouraging and motivating the people. Creating awareness is the first step. Repeated meetings with 
self-help groups, organisations of women and elderly citizens, village administration, schools, involvement in 
festival and religious gathering etc are helpful. It is important to ensure that minority groups, low status groups 
and poorer groups in the community are not left out.
Impact of a successful community-based palliative care program
If any program is effective and successful, it is easier to advocate with the government to include it into the main 
health policy."

 ∙Describe the salient features of National Programme for Palliative Care
 ∙Describe the scope of palliative care under other national health programmes
 ∙Describe the referral mechanisms for patients needing Palliative Care
Though our country has great need, palliative care has not been focus area for our health systems. However, over 
last decade there have been some patchy attempts to provide palliative care its due place in the public health 
system. These have been summarized below.
National Programme for Palliative Care [NPPC]:
National Programme for Palliative Care was launched in 2012. The programme is part of flexi pool under 
National Health Mission. Currently it has been integrated with National Programme for Prevention and Control 
of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS).
 ¾Goal: 
Availability and accessibility of rational, quality pain relief and palliative care to the needy, as an integral part of 
Health Care at all levels, in alignment with the community requirements.
 ¾Objectives:
The key objectives of the programme are as following:
 ∙Improve the capacity to provide palliative care service delivery within government health programs.
 ∙Refine the legal and regulatory systems, support implementation to ensure access and availability of 
Opioids.
 ∙Encourage attitudinal shifts amongst healthcare professionals
 ∙Promote behaviour change in the community
 ∙Develop national standards for palliative care
The major strategies proposed are provision of funds for establishing state palliative care cell and palliative care 
services at the district hospital.
National Health Policy:
The latest National Health Policy was adopted in the year 2017.  The policy recognizes the growing need for 
palliative and rehabilitative care for all geriatric illnesses and advocates the continuity of care across all levels.
The objective of the policy is to “Improve health status through concerted policy action in all sectors and expand 
preventive, promotive, curative, palliative and rehabilitative services provided through the public health sector 
with focus on quality”. Chapter 9 : Palliative Care in National Health Programmes"
Palliative Care Training Manual for ASHA at AB-HWC,44,"44
44The policy denotes important change from very selective to comprehensive primary health care package which 
includes geriatric health care, palliative care and rehabilitative care services. It envisages enhanced capacity 
building related to Palliative care both in health services and training. Palliative care has also been considered to 
be part of Right to Healthcare by the policy.
Palliative Care in other National Programmes:
Recently Palliative Care services are also included under other national health programmes. 
 ¾National AIDS Control Programme has identified the palliative care as an important component of the car, 
support and treatment in managing the HIV pandemic. The focus is on symptom management of patients, 
psychosocial, spiritual and bereavement support for both patients and families. Home care has been considered 
to be of great importance in meeting the palliative care needs of HIV positive patients and families. Children 
(both HIV positive and negative have been identified as special focus group) Peer counsellors, outreach 
workers (ORW), link worker or ASHA are expected to play important role. 
 ¾National Tuberculosis Elemination Programme has also identified the unmet palliative care needs of palliative 
care especially in those suffering from drug resistant tuberculosis. Palliative care would be offered through the 
nodal DR-TB centers or at the community level under guidance of nodal DR-TB center. Necessary services 
include pain relief, psychosocial support, respiratory physiotherapy, nutritional support etc. 
 ¾Ayushman Bharat Yojana:
Ayushman Bharat Yojana launched in 2018, has two components:
1. Pradahan Mantri, Jan ArogyaYojana[ Health Insurance Scheme]
2. Comprehensive Primary Healthcare through Health & Wellness Centres [HWC].
Palliative Care has been included as an expanded range of services along with Healthcare of the elderly.  Support 
to the families in Palliative care and availability of basic pain management and palliative care services through 
HWC. Preventive Promotive

Competency: Demonstrates an understanding of the roles, responsibilities, scope and ASHA in context of 
providing Palliative care to the communities
Specific Learning Objectives
 ∙Describe the proposed role of Health & Wellness Centres in Palliative Care
 ∙Describe the expected role of ASHA in Palliative Care
 ¾The people in the community who suffer from chronic, incurably illnesses or are bed ridden face problems in 
day to day living as well as healthcare.
 ¾They are emotionally upset, socially isolated, have to depend on others for care and survival. Hospitals often 
feel that ‘there is nothing more to be done’ and send them away.
 ¾These patients can get good quality palliative care through primary health care and home care. This needs 
the support of the people and the community.
 ¾The Frontline Workers comprising of MPW(F/M) and ASHA is the most important person linking up the 
patient, community and health institutions.
Roles and Responsiblities of ASHA in Palliative Care 
 ASHA will identify bed ridden patients and others needing Palliative care.
While filling the Community Based Assessment Checklist, you will fill a question in the general information 
section-
“Does this person have any of the following:
Visible defect/known disability/Bed ridden/require support for Activities of Daily Living”
If the answer to any of these is Yes, you will refer to the CHO for further assessment.
 Undertake regular home visits to the patients and provide psychosocial support to the patients and family 
members.
 ASHA will assist the family members in routine home care, simple nursing skills and accessing various service 
as needed including mobilization of local resources.
 Create awareness about palliative care.
 Identify and refer patients to the Community Health Officer as and when required.
 Identify community volunteers for palliative care.
 Work with MPW(F/M) to provide basic patient management services.
 Provide psychosocial support to the families/patients
 Facilitate affected families to get appropriate documentation to avail eligible social entitlements by linking 
them to Gram Panchayat or other relevant agencies.
 Escort the patient/family during initial visits to ensure better liaison between beneficiary and service providers.Chapter 10 : Roles and Responsibilities of ASHA in 
Palliative Care"

 Render psychosocial support to the bereaved family as required.
 ASHA should be able to communicate compassionately with the patient and family, answering all their queries 
with knowledge, patience and understanding. She should also be able to communicate effectively with team 
members.
 Equip the care givers in performing simple nursing taskand  should help  them take suitable decisions and help 
them carry these out.
 ASHA will utilize meetings of the Village Health Nutrition and Sanitation Committee/Mahila Arogya Samiti 
(VHSNC/MAS) to raise awareness about the needs of palliative care patients, and mobilize individual and 
community level support, including accessing assistance available through other Government programmes. 
 ASHA will identify a group of volunteers in her service area. Volunteers could be drawn from Youth Groups, 
Mahila Mandals, Co-operatives, Non-Governmental Organizations, etc.
 Follow the basic principles of caring such as safety of the patient and care giver, effectiveness of the 
interventions, provide physical and psychological support, appropriate use of resource, adequate knowledge 
and skill, providing individualized care.
 All the information about the patient and family is strictly confidential, to be discussed only with necessary 
team members so that the patient’s privacy and dignity is maintained.
 ASHA will document the Palliative care services provided as per annexure 1 document and will submit the 
same at the Sub Centre as part of her monthly report
 ASHA identifies and refers those needing more care to ANM/ Community Health Officer. The referral 
pathway are as follows"

BACKGROUND
Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disease in which the red blood cells have an abnormal 
half-moon shape. It is more common in the tribal population of India but occurs in non-
tribals too. It leads to anaemia, pain, and reduced growth, and affects many organs like the 
lungs, heart, kidneys, eyes, bones, and brain.
The tribal health expert committee report, 2018 has listed sickle cell disease as one of the 10 
priority problems in tribal health. About 1 in 86 births among the tribal population have SCD, 
the prevalence being higher in Central, Western, and Southern India. However, now SCD is 
found across all ethnicities and communities.
States with prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease include- Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, 
Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil 
Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh & Assam. Tribal 
communities in India have poorer health indicators, a greater burden of morbidity and 
mortality, and limited access to health care services. To enable access to affordable and 
quality health care for all SCD patients, and to lower the prevalence, Government of India has 
launched a mission to eliminate sickle cell disease by 2047. 
This will improve the care of all Sickle Cell Disease patients for a better future and will lower 
the prevalence of the disease through a multi-faced coordinated approach with focus on 
screening and awareness strategies.
A community health worker, MPW (M/F) / ASHA will play a pivotal role in eliminating sickle 
cell disease through health promotion and prevention activities in the community."

CHAPTER 1: 
UNDERSTANDING SICKLE CELL DISEASE
Let us first understand what Sickle cell disease is. Then we will learn about its symptoms that 
will help you to identify and refer the patients to AB-HWC. 
A genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. It is passed on from parents to children.
Red blood cells normally look like round discs. But in a person with sickle cell disease, 
they are shaped like sickles or half-moons.1.1 What is Sickle Cell Disease?
lives up to 120 dayslive up to 10-20 days
Figure 2 Normal and Sickled Red Blood Cells
Normal red blood cells flow freely 
through small blood vessels.
Figure 3 Normal Blood flow
Sickled red blood cells are rigid, 
and sticky cells. They get stuck in 
small blood vessels and slow 
down or block blood flow 
Figure 4 Blood flow in Sickle Cell Disease
This can cause pain and other serious complications (health problems) related to the heart, 
lungs, kidneys, and other organs because not enough blood and oxygen are reaching the 
organs.
Normal red blood cells can live up to 120 days but sickle cells live for about 10 to 20 days"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,7,"81.2 What causes sickle cell?
Sickle cell disease is not an infectious disease but rather a genetic disorder, which is 
carried onto families by genes. Genes are found inside cells and carry information that 
gets passed from parents to children. 
 Genes carry the information that determines your features or 
characteristics that are passed on to a child from parents
For example, if both parents have green eyes, their child might have green eyes
(where green eyes is an information which is passed)
HbA – Normal Haemoglobin
HbS – Sickle Haemoglobin/ Abnormal haemoglobin
Sickle cell disease is not an infectious disease. It runs in familiesSickle Cell Trait• A child who gets a sickle 
cell gene from one parent 
and a normal hemoglobin 
gene from the other parent 
has sickle cell trait
Sickle Cell 
Disease (HbSS)• A child who gets two 
sickle cell genes, one from 
each parent, will have sickle 
cell disease.

Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,8,"9If one parent has sickle cell trait and the other has sickle cell disease, then children have a 50% chance of being diseased 
and 50% of being carriersIf both parents have sickle cell disease, there is a 100% chance that their children will be born with the disease
If one parent is normal and the other has sickle cell disease, then children have a 100% chance of being carriers
If both parents have sickle cell trait, their children have a 25% chance of being diseased, a 25% chance of being normal, 
and a 50% chance of being carriers
If one parent has sickle cell trait and the other is normal, then children have a 50% chance of being normal and 50% 
chance of being carriersNormal hemoglobin Sickle cell trait Sickle cell diseaseA pictorial depiction of different combinations of parents’ disease status and the probability of 
the children getting affected is as below:
A person with Sickle Cell Trait is referred to as a carrier and does not always show the symptom 
of the disease. However, there is a possibility that his/her children will inherit the Sickle Cell 
Disease if he/she happens to marry a Sickle Cell Carrier or Sickle Cell Disease patient."
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,9,"101.3 Clinical presentation of sickle cell disease
The signs and symptoms of sickle cell disease vary greatly from person to person. Some 
people are quite healthy and are diagnosed at relatively old age; some are frequently 
hospitalised and may have complications, while some may die at an early age from the 
disease and its complications. 
Anaemia –  People with Sickle Cell Disease have low red blood count. This 
makes them tired easily.   
Frequent infections Children under the age of five are at the highest risk. 
Mainly infections can occur in the lungs, blood, and brain.
Fever - A fever may be the first sign of an infection. 
Jaundice –  Yellow colour usually seen in the white of the eyes. This is usually 
a mild and common problem.
Episodes of pain -  Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are 
major symptoms of sickle cell disease. Pain occurs in Joints, Chest, Back, and 
Abdomen. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few 
days. Some people have only a few pain crises while some may have more. 
Swelling of hands and feet -  The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red 
blood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet.
Delayed growth or puberty -  A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow 
growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers.
Vision problems  -  Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become 
plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina — the portion of the 
eye that processes visual images — and lead to vision problems.
Leg ulcer -  Leg ulcers are painful and often disabling complications of SCD.
Priapism-  Prolonged painful erection of the penis without sexual arousal.

Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,10,"111.4 How can Sickle cell disease be treated?
1.5 How can Sickle cell disease be prevented?Treatment for sickle cell disease is usually aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing 
complications. Early diagnosis and prevention of complications is critical in sickle cell 
disease treatment. With early intervention together with parental education and 
involvement, affected people live longer and survive into middle and late adulthood 
As it is a genetic condition someone is born with, the best-suited control measure of 
prevention is stopping the disease from passing on to the next generation. People with 
sickle cell trait need to be identified and counselled on marriage so that the sickle cell 
trait and the sickle cell disease and disease are not transmitted to future generations. 
Children with sickle cell disease can lead a normal life with proper treatment and care
They can grow to be healthy and productive citizens
Let us Recap
/c63 Sickle cell is a genetic disease affecting the red blood cells.
/c63 SCD can only be passed on from parents to their children through genes and is not 
transmitted by any other means.
/c63 The chances for a child to inherit Sickle Cell Disease in different cases are as below   "

PREVENTION OF SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND 
ROLE OF MPW (M/F) / ASHA IN PREVENTION
Since you have understood what is sickle cell disease, this chapter will explain your role in 
prevention of the disease. 
As an MPW (M/F) / ASHA your major role is in preventing the disease in your community. You 
should take steps to create awareness and provide information to the community about sickle 
cell disease prevention.
Screening is done to identify individuals with sickle cell disease or carrier. It is done at the 
Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWC) and also in the community 
through screening camps
There are tests which are done to screen people for sickle cell disease. Let us now learn about 
them.
Two types of tests are available for screening:
1. Solubility Test – This is a test tube-based test which can be used for mass screening. This 
is a rapid test and requires a very small blood sample. Solubility tests can be used at 
screening sites or at healthcare facilities. This test tells about the presence of abnormal 
haemoglobin in the blood. The procedure for conducting solubility test is attached as 
Annexure 1.2.1 Tools for Screening

Carrier Diseased Normal"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,13,"14
2. Point of Care Test (POC) – It is a confirmatory test. This test can be done both at the 
community and facility level. It distinguishes between normal, carrier and diseased 
individual. 
Figure 6 Point of care test
Therefore, we should first identify the status of the individuals, and then proceed towards 
management of the disease. In sickle cell prevalent areas, universal screening of all population 
up to the age of 18 years is done using a mass screening approach in the first year and the entire 
population up to 40 years is to be screened subsequently and incrementally in three years.
Certain target groups are identified in the community for screening. These target groups are 
given below in the flow chart.
For prevention of Sickle Cell Disease, there are certain target groups that you should consider. 
The following table describes the various screening approaches and your role in each 
approach."

Every individual who is screened for SCD will be provided with a Sickle cell card. The 
card will show the status of the individual viz, Normal, Carrier or Diseased. The cards 
will be color coded separately for males (blue) and females (pink). Based on the card’s 
status the individual will receive treatment and counselling services.2.2 Sickle Cell Status Identity Cards"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,15,"16 
 
 
 
 
• The card contains details such as gender, and test report (Sickle cell disease/ sickle cell 
carrier/ Normal) on the front side of the card. On the back of the card possibility of 
having the disease in a child is explained for two individuals having sickle cell cards. 
• In each sickle cell card, there will be three holes present on the extreme left on the back 
side of the card. While matching two sickle cell cards (1 male and 1 female card) the 
three holes in one card will coincide with the in another card at two places. At one 
position both card’s holes will completely coincide and no    will be seen. The individual 
should check the statement written adjacent to that position. 
• The back-side of the card contains possible outcomes of conception if any persons 
having sickle cell disease or carrier status marry. 
Cards distributed to males are of blue colour as depicted in the figure below:People screened at AB-HWC/ Screening Camps

Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,20,"21CHAPTER 3: 
ROLE OF MPW-M/F/ASHA IN SCD PREVENTION 
AND COUNSELLING
Let us now read about your roles in detail. 
• You should be engaged in raising awareness against SCDs through home visits
• You should make a line listing of identified SCD carrier and SCD patients within your 
catchment area. 
• You should prepare a list of eligible couples, which may be linked with the 
programme to identify and provide genetic counselling and mobilize the couples to 
the nearest Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centre (AB-HWC)
• Motivate pregnant women and their partners to screen for SCD
• Follow-up of diagnosed individuals for undergoing treatment
• Follow-up of the patients undergoing hydroxyurea therapy
• You as a member of community platforms (VHSNC, JAS, MAS) should leverage these 
platforms to sensitize people on the importance of sickle cell disease and screening 
service available at AB-HWCs
• You should mobilize the eligible population for screening camps/ facility-level 
screening
• You should mobilise patients for Patients Support Group (PSG) meetings with 
support from ANM/CHO/MO.
• You should facilitate discussions for experience sharing by patients and caregivers 
and to enhance treatment adherence.
• You should refer all the eligible individuals and couples identified as positive or 
carriers either at the community level to the CHO at SHC-HWC for further advise.
• Support CHO in conducting outreach screening camps for sickle cell anaemia
• Screening of remote and inaccessible tribal hamlets through Mobile Medical Units
•  Counselling and social support  
• Referral of screened patients with solubility test positive 
• Screening of children in Anganwadis / Schools / Ashramshalas3.1 At individual/household level:
3.2 At Community-level:"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,21,"223.3 Key messages for Counselling
A. Dietary Modification
You must tell them about following dietary modifications
• Prefer food having carbohydrates which do not rapidly increase sugar level in blood. 
They should be rich in fibre to maintain a healthy gut and immunity. e.g. whole 
cereals and grains, millets, whole pulses and legumes
• Include vegetable and animal sources of protein in the diet, such as nuts, milk, pulses 
and legumes or egg, fish, meat.
• Use healthy fats for cooking e.g. fats from plant origin and nuts &seed oils e.g. 
Ground nut oil, mustard oil, coconut oil.
•  Include locally available seasonal fruits and vegetables of different colours in the diet 
to meet required fibre, and nutrients.
• Consume water and other liquids to maintain hydration.
• Frequent meals/ feeds at regular intervals should be taken to achieve the desired goal 
of nutrition.
Restrict foods which lower immunity
•   Bakery items
•   Refined cereal and grains
•   Packaged foods, sweetened Juices and cold drinks
•   Excess fat, sugar and salty food items
B. Support for adolescents
The adolescence period is a difficult time emotionally and in patients with chronic 
diseases, like SCD,  this leads to more stress. The adolescent may be busy with school 
studies and forget to take medicines, drink fluids, may become irregular with meals. 
Teens may be irritable and moody, with altered sleep cycles. Adolescents may rebel and 
become less compliant with treatment. This transitional time can be high risk for non-
compliance and psycho –social problems complicating treatment compliance.
Some simple steps to assist adolescent to reach to selfcare:
• Ensure adequate knowledge about general health maintenance 
• Explain why pain occur and practical things to help- fluids, diet, medicines, malaria prevention 
• Introduce to peers/ support groups if not already 
• Have role models from community 
• Assess for inadequate coping and depression
• Community programs or SCD family programs to explain about normal teenage behaviour can 
be helpful"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,22,"23C. Patients on treatment
• Patients should be reminded that the effectiveness of medication (hydroxyurea) depends on 
their adherence to daily dosing
• Should be counselled not to double doses if a dose is missed 
• Females of reproductive age should be counselled about consulting doctors regarding 
medication (hydroxyurea) prior to conceiving 
• Clinical response to treatment may take 3 to 6 months "
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,23,"24Annexure 1 - Solubility test
The solubility test is done to identify altered haemoglobin, either homozygous sickle cell 
anaemia of heterozygous sickle cell trait. 
Requirements
1. Syringe
2. Blood collection vial lined with anticoagulant
3. Sickle cell buffer reagent – R1
4. Sickle cell powder reagent – R2
5. 2 Vials – one for sample one for control 
6. Dropper 
Precautions
1. Store reagent at room temperature
2. Discard reagent on appearance of turbidity, which will not dissolve upon mixing
o3. Store the blood sample at 4-8 C
4. Severe anaemia will cause false negative. Hb concentration should be 7 g/dl or more. 
Cases of polycythaemia, multiple myeloma, cryoglobu linemia and other 
dysglobulinemia also have the chances of providing false negative results. 
Preparation of working solution
1. Bring buffer and reagent powder at room temperature before mixing
2. Add one vial of powder reagent (R2) to one bottle of buffer reagent (R1). Cover the cap of 
R2 bottle and mix vigorously.
3. Record the reconstitution date and expiry date on the vial
o4. Store the solubility buffer tightly capped at 2-8 C
5. Use the buffer within 45 days
Procedure
1. Prepare the working solution. If already prepared bring to room temperature
2. Collect whole blood in a vial 
3. Add 2.0 ml of working solution buffer reagent to two tubes and label sample and control
4. Add 0.02 ml (20 ìl) of whole blood to the sample vial and plug it. Mix by inversion. 
5. Place in the test tube rack for 5 minutes. 
6. Read the test in sufficient light after 5 minutes against lines placed in the background"
Training Manual on SCD for MPW & ASHA,24,"25Inference
1. Positive result (presence of sickled haemoglobin) – If the solution turns turbid and the 
background lines are not visible 
2. Compare the turbidity of tst solution with negative control solution if observed more 
solution say positive
3. Heterozygous - Red-pink supernatant with a dark red band at the top.
4. Homozygous - Yellowish supernatant with a dark red band at the top.
5. Negative result (no presence of sickled haemoglobin) – If the clear or turbid solution 
permits the lines to be seen through the tube. Slight greyish matter on top of deep red 
haemolysate.
6. If in confusion refer the case for electrophoresis"

1.1 BACKGroUnd
The implementation of the National Health Mission (NHM), has 
helped India in reducing maternal and child deaths, and greatly improved access of women and children to health care services. 
In your own communities, you would have seen an increase 
in children getting immunized, in pregnant women getting antenatal care, in using health care facilities for deliveries, in the use of family planning by couples, and generally making more use of health care facilities. A large part of this success can be 
attributed to your work as an ASHA. However, many healthcare challenges persist, and they need our 
attention.
One example of this continuing challenge is malnutrition among young children. You know from your 
training that child malnutrition is an important cause of deaths in under-five children. Children who are undernourished have increased risk to infections, frequent episodes of illness and take longer to recover. Malnutrition also affects their physical growth and mental development. There are many 
programmes to address this problem, but the burden of malnutrition in children continues to remain 
high in our country.
it is observed that- 
• About half of the children under 6 months of age are exclusively breastfed.
• About 4 children out of 10 children under 3 years are breastfed within one hour of birth.
• 1 child out of 10 breastfeeding children aged 6-23 months receive an adequate diet (adequate 
diet means-feeding several times a day as per the age recommendation and giving a diverse variety of foods to meet the requirement for optimal growth and development).
• More than half the children between 6-59 months of age are anaemic (haemoglobin level less 
than 11.0g/dl). 
Underweight Children
About 4 children out of 10 children under five 
years of age are underweight (have low weight for their age).
Wasted Children
About 2 children out of 10 children under five years of age are wasted (have low weight for their length/height).
stunted Children
About 4 children out of 10 children under five years of age are stunted (have low height for their age).

Early childhood is the most rapid period of development in human life and ensuring care of the 
mother and the child from the point of conception to the first few years of life lays the basis for 
healthy mental, emotional and physical growth of children.
A healthy childhood is not achieved by providing adequate nutrition and health care alone. Children 
need an environment with parents/caregivers giving them love, affection and appreciation. It is 
important for parents/caregivers to spend time playing and communicating with children for social, mental and emotional development, which ultimately leads to healthy and happy children, leading to 
a productive society. Such development helps the child to improve learning capacity, perform better 
in school and form strong social bonds. 
1.2  introdUCtion And rA tion Ale F or home BA sed CAre F or 
YOUNG CHILD (HBYC) PROGRAMME 
There are many tasks that you as an ASHA are already undertaking to 
address the health and nutrition needs of newborns, infants and children 
up to the age of five years. You are undertaking 6/7 home visits to 
provide Home Based Newborn Care (HBNC) up to 42 days after the birth. In case of low birth weight (LBW) babies, Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU)/Newborn Stabilization Unit (NBSU) and Nutrition 
Rehabilitation Centre (NRC) discharged babies, day of discharge is 
counted as day 1 of home visit schedule and the six remaining home visits are completed as per HBNC visit schedule i.e. 3rd, 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th and 42nd day from the day of discharge. The HBNC visits enabled 
continuity of care and ensured survival of the new born. 
The first six weeks of life is a time of 
vulnerability for the child and your 
role in undertaking frequent home 
visits during this period to provide Home Based Newborn Care is vital. 
However, the period after the first 
42 days to the first few years of life is also important. After this period your visits and child’s contact with the health systems is limited to 
immunization, in case of illness or 
for management of malnutrition.
It has also been observed that around 3 months of age and beyond, problems such as discontinuation 
of breastfeeding, delay in initiation or incomplete complementary feeding beyond six months, 
poor care seeking for sickness, etc. arise. In addition, poor hygiene and sanitation and poor  child 
rearing practices in the home during this period may also lead to sub-optimal physical growth and

development of the child. Through structured home visits, these issues can be identified early and 
appropriate actions can be taken, thus reducing the adverse impact of these factors.
To provide support for nutrition and early childhood development, the Home Based Care for Young 
Child (HBYC) has been launched as part of the National Health Mission and POSHAN Abhiyaan of the 
Ministry of Women and Child Development.
The goals of POSHAN Abhiyaan are to:
• Prevent and reduce stunting and undernutrition amongst children in the age group of 0-6 years 
by 2% per year, respectively; and
• Reduce the prevalence of anaemia in children (6-59 months) by  3% per year.
• Reduce low birth weight by 2% per year.
1.3 oBJe CtiVes oF hBYC
The objectives of HBYC are to:
• Reduce child deaths and illnesses;
• Improve nutritional status of young children; and
• Ensure proper growth and early childhood development of young children.
As part of HBYC initiative, you will undertake 
five additional  home visits after the 42nd day, in 
addition to the 6/7 visits for HBNC. You will visit 
the child on completion of  3 months, 6 months, 9 
months, 12 months and 15 months. In addition, 
the quarterly home visits schedule for low birth 
weight babies, SNCU and NRC discharged children that you are already making will be included into this HBYC schedule. 
Home visits will allow you to identify problems early and support families in taking the appropriate 
action, whether through improved home care practices or through visiting health facilities. The additional home visits will increase contacts with the child and parents/caregivers during the first 
fifteen months of life, providing opportunities for the following:
• Promote exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life.
• Emphasize timely, adequate and appropriate complementary 
feeding for children on completion of six months and beyond.
• Build the capacity of mothers/caregivers through counselling and support to identify and manage problems related to 
nutrition and health in their child.

• Allow for early identification of delay in growth and development of children by using the  
MCP card. 
• Enable prevention and management of common childhood illnesses. 
• Ensure prompt referral of sick children to health facilities for management of complications.
• Follow-up for compliance to medication and care of sick children discharged from health facilities.
The HBYC programme will target all children (girls and boys) between 3 months up to 15 months 
of age. However, you have to give special attention to the healthcare and follow-up needs of low 
birth weight children, sick children, malnourished children and children discharged from SNCU/
NBSU and NRC. 
Using past training experience, ensure that girl children receive equal care and attention as given 
to boys. Therefore, counselling of parents/caregivers during home visits to avoid discrimination on 
account of gender should be given due priority.

2.1 r oles And resP onsiBilities oF A shA in home B Ased CAre 
2.1.1  Your role as an ASHA under HBYC programme is linked to each of the four components- Nutrition, 
Health including family planning for the couple, Early Childhood Development and Water, Sanitation 
and Hygiene (WASH). These are explained in detail in sections 4-7 of this handbook. 
HBYC does not mean that the focus on the newborn is reduced. The 6/7 visits you make as part 
of HBNC will continue, and you will undertake the following activities, which you have already been undertaking. You will also continue to fill the HBNC form (Mother-Newborn Home  
Visit Card) as you have been trained to do. Just to recapitulate, few of the activities under HBNC are listed below:
2.1.2 The activities for HBYC are based on the revised Mother and Child Protection 
(MCP) card. The MCP card forms the basis for you to plan interventions, both 
for yourself and as support to AWW/ANM (MPW). The MCP card will work as a 
reference material to help you complete all the activities. In the training, you will be taught how to use the revised MCP card and undertake age-appropriate actions as listed in the card (Refer page-8 in the MCP card). The ASHA Facilitator (AF) and 
ANM/MPW will provide support and supervise you in effectively carrying out the 
activities under HBYC.  1. Counsel mothers and families on key messages on newborn care such as infant 
and young child feeding, assessment of malnutrition, keeping the newborn warm, promotion of hand- washing, etc. 
2. Provide skin, cord and eye care of the child.
3. Assess if the child is high risk, pre-term or low birth weight, and take action accordingly. 
4. Support the mother in sustaining breast feeding through teaching the mother proper positioning and attachment, diagnosing and counselling in case there are problems with breastfeeding. 
5. Teach the mother to express breastmilk and feed baby using cup and spoon in case of pre-mature newborn in order to sustain breastfeeding.
6. Advocate the family regarding the need for the mother to get adequate rest and nutrition which helps the mother in recovering 
from child-birth and in breastfeeding.
7. Monitor newborn’s weight and temperature. 
8. Look for any signs of sickness and arrange for prompt referral to appropriate 
facility in case you find danger signs in newborn. 
9. Discourage unhealthy practices such as early bathing, bottle feeding, etc.

3.1 PlAnninG F or home Visits
Quarterly home visits under HBYC will need to be carefully planned as this intervention covers 
children in various age groups. 
To plan your visits, you need to have the following:
1. AshA diary/register- To help you list all young children between 3 months-15 
months of age in your area. Among these, you will require to prepare an updated 
list of children who have registered in Anganwadi Centre (AWC) and are due for 
immunization. 
2. hBYC card- HBYC card will be used to record details of activities undertaken 
by you for receiving incentives for five additional home visits for each young 
child (Annexure-1). The HBYC card will be provided to you by your state for 
recording details of activities for each child. You will tick mark (√) and write yes/no (as specified) 
against the activities conducted in two forms- HBYC card and in the MCP card (page-8) of the mother/caregiver. HBYC card will be the basis for your payment. The MCP card will be retained by the mother/caregiver.
3. Job-Aid- Job-Aid will be provided to you to conduct the home visits more effectively. This will help 
you in recalling the key messages to be given to the mother/caregiver during each HBYC visit.
4. mCP card- You will be provided a copy of new MCP card during your training and you will be 
required to use the MCP card as a reference material during your HBYC visits. 
5. medicines dosage and dispensing schedule  for sick child 
management is provided in Annexure-2.
6. AshA Kit- 
You will continue to use (medicines and HBNC kit) that 
has been earlier provided to you for HBNC. 
7. items required for screening in early Childhood development- 
In Annexure 3, there is a list of commonly available items that are

• Greet appropriately and ask how the family is.
• Explain why you are visiting and that you are there to 
help.
• Be friendly and respectful.
• Speak with a gentle voice.
• Use simple words in local language and advise appropriately.
• Listen carefully-Encourage the mother/caregiver and family members to speak.
• Listen patiently to what the mother/caregiver and family members speak. 
• Empathize with the family if there are any problems.
• Praise what the mother/caregiver/family member is doing correctly and build up their self-
confidence.
• Do not be judgmental.
• Ask the right questions. Ask open- ended questions (where you can get responses from the 
mother/caregivers).
• Check if the family members or mother have any questions.
• Thank the family after the visit and inform them when you will return. 
given for teaching the mother/caregivers to conduct age-specific milestone assessments for the 
child. These items will be locally available in your area (e.g. handbell, torch, red plastic bangle, plastic 
mirror, etc.) and can be collected while planning your HBYC visits to demonstrate use of these items 
to the mother/caregivers. Some of these items may also be easily available from the nearest AWC.
3.2  estimA tinG the nUmBer oF Children to Be C oVered BY

An estimate of the number of children that you would need to cover 
in your home visits-  In a population of 1000, you will generally have 30 
newborns per year. This means 2-3 newborns (30/12 months) will be 
added every month in your coverage area. 
remember- It is not necessary that each ASHA will have exactly 1000 
population under her. There is a variation in the population covered 
under ASHA across the states.
Before undertaking each visit, it will be useful to recall principles of 
communication to be followed during home visits that have been taught to you in earlier trainings.estimate of children

the HBYC card filled by the ASHA with the MCP card of the mother. The existing mechanism of payment 
to ASHAs will be followed to ensure timely payment. ANM/MPW will also visit 10% children of her service area as  joint household visits with ASHAs.  
3.5 AddressinG soCiAl VUlnerABilitY F or hBYC
You have learnt about ‘vulnerable or marginalised’ population in your community in the module on ‘Reaching the Unreached’ and why is it important 
to ensure that they receive healthcare services.
Vulnerable or marginalised population are those groups of people or families 
in our communities who belong to any of the categories listed below-
• Families belonging to a particular caste, ethnic, or religious group 
who are a minority in the community and who are not seen as equals by others. They could belong to scheduled castes, scheduled tribes 
and minority communities. 
• Women headed households: Where the husband works outside the 
village, where women are separated or deserted by their husbands, or the husband is dead, where women have alcoholic husbands, or husbands 
who are differently abled and women bear the sole responsibility for 
earning a livelihood and taking care of the family. 
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,20,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child20
• Families living in distant hamlets/tolas, whose houses lie between villages on hilltops or in 
the fields, or in areas which are cut off during the rainy season. 
• Families living in slum/slum like locations, homeless people 
living on roadsides, under bridges, flyovers, along railway tracks, 
in night shelters, homeless recovery shelters, beggars’ home, leprosy homes, etc. 
• Families with differently abled children, unaccompanied 
children, elderly people or families where there is no adult 
support. Families having members living with HIV and AIDS, Tuberculosis, Leprosy, etc.
• Migrant families, either those who migrate into the village community, or those who stay outside the village for livelihood such as to urban areas- cities, towns, etc. and return periodically. 
• Families engaged in unorganised/informal work and hazardous 
occupation- construction, brick and lime kiln workers, head 
loaders, sex workers, ragpickers, street children, etc. 
• Families of those who work as daily wage labourers or are 
seasonal workers, who have no employment and are destitute. 
• Displaced populations usually in the case of any sudden impact 
disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood-like situation, threat or conflict, etc.
In addition to these social categories, two classes of children are particularly vulnerable. 
1. Girl children- Across the country, we note that boys are given preference 
over girls whether in feeding or health care-seeking for any illness. Girl 
children are therefore particularly vulnerable and you must ensure that 
your visits to homes with girl children also highlights the importance of equal non-discriminatory behaviour in addition to other support that you 
provide. 
2. sick children- Low birth weight children, malnourished children, 
children discharged from SNCU/NRC, children sick due to any childhood 
illnesses, children with feeding disorders, 
etc. have compromised growth, are prone to repeated infections and 
therefore need particular attention.
You have already learnt regarding ‘the eiGht -Fold Path’, for 
identifying the vulnerable and marginalised population and your role 
in each of the steps listed.

Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child21
As the ASHA and a member of the community you know the families who fall in the category of being 
vulnerable and marginalised. Your prime focus should be on children belonging to such families who 
are the most vulnerable and likely to be unreached. 
 1. mapping
You have already mapped children under five years of age within your 
population. Ensure that a list of all those families which fall in the categories of being vulnerable and marginalised (as discussed above) having 
children from 3 months to 15 months of age is prepared and updated on a  
routine basis.
 2. Prioritizing
Under HBYC, you are required to make quarterly home visits to all children between 3 months to 15 
months of age. However, due to specific constraints, children belonging to vulnerable and marginalised households may get missed. You need to make extra efforts to ensure 
that children from such families are not missed. Once you have mapped 
all children eligible for HBYC in your population, you will particularly focus on vulnerable and marginalised-families having girl child, where 
children have not registered at the Anganwadi centre, families that do 
not visit the Village Health Nutrition Day (VHND)/Urban Health Nutrition Day (UHND) sessions, where a previous child death has occurred, where children are malnourished, where children have not 
been identified or admitted for nutritional rehabilitation due to lack of 
prompt access to healthcare services, children discharged from SNCU or NRC, families where children fall ill frequently or live in unhygienic conditions, etc.
 3. Communicating
You should inform the families about why these services are needed, where they are available, and what their health entitlements are. The job-aid and MCP card which will be used as reference material can 
help ensure that you do not miss any important message for the child during the scheduled home-visits.
 4. Understanding
Often people have a reason or a problem for why they are not able to use health services. Do not 
assume that their attitudes are bad. You may have to explore options for changing the way existing 
services are being provided. You will have to discuss these concerns with your supervisors and bring 
to their notice. For instance, in some cases, the ANM/MPW will need to make a home visit to provide immunization to the child, or the Anganwadi worker will have to deliver the Take Home Ration (THR) to the household for the child or to record weight and length/height of the child to monitor growth. 
You may have to accompany these mothers/ caregivers during VHND/UHND sessions or healthcare 
facilities if required, etc.
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,22,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child22
 5. Counselling
Listen to people’s problems, build a relationship of trust, and 
work with them to find solutions. You could accompany them 
to the VHND/UHND or the health facility so that they feel 
comfortable and confident about accessing them on their own in the future. 
 6. Persisting
Changing behaviours is not very easy to do, especially among poor and marginalized families, who may not perceive the immediate gains of your home visits or for whom there are other important 
priorities. It needs repeated visits and counselling so that these visits are beneficial for proper growth 
and development of their children. Keep in mind that once the families overcome their reluctance to adopt preventive and promotive health behaviours and begin to access health services, your need for frequent visits will reduce. 
 7. Coordinating
It is quite likely that there still remain families, who despite your persistent efforts will not access services. You can ask members of the Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee 
(VHSNC), Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS), Self- Help Group (SHG) or request your ASHA Facilitator 
or the ANM/MPW, who may be in a position to influence these families, to accompany you on a home visit.
 8. mobilizing
Getting people together gives people the confidence to change. Organization provides strength. Building solidarity creates confidence. Leadership provides inspiration and optimism to break out 
of age-old inertia. So, organize community meetings, join together to sing songs, take out a rally, and 
celebrate survival. Mobilization is the most important tool of all.

4.1 eXCl UsiVe Bre AstFeedinG 
In our country, only about half of the children under 6 months of age are being exclusively breastfed. 
In ASHA Module 6 and 7, you have already been trained on key concepts of breastfeeding. The training helped you to counsel mothers and clear their misconceptions related to breastfeeding. 
This section will further reinforce some of these important concepts to counsel families (mothers and 
caregivers) during your HBYC visits. 
4.1.1 WHAT IS Ex CLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING?
Exclusive breastfeeding means feeding the child onl Y breast 
milk for the first 6 months (180 days). Breast milk provides all nutrients and contains sufficient water to meet the requirements of the child up to six months of age; the infants who are exclusively breastfed do not require anything else. 
4.1.2 ELICITING INFORMATION ABOUT Ex CLUSIVE 
BREASTFEEDING DURING HOME VISITS
• Greet the woman in a kind and friendly way while using the mother’s/caregiver’s and child’s 
name. 
• Ask her to tell you about herself and her child in her own way, starting with the things that she feels are important.
• To know more about breastfeeding practices, you can ask questions like:
 ¾What do you feed the child?
 ¾If child is breastfed, ask how many times in the whole day, the child is breastfed? 
 ¾Is the child given anything other than breast milk (other milk, water, etc.)?
• Listen but be careful not to sound critical. Try not to repeat questions. Some mothers/caregivers 
tell you these things spontaneously. Others will give you information when you empathize and 
show that you understand how they feel. Some mothers/caregivers take longer.
• Encourage the mother/caregivers to contact you, or the AWW or the ANM/MPW of their area in case of problems related to breastfeeding. 
4.1.3 IMPORTANT MESSAGES FOR BREASTFEEDING
You may refer to page 10 of MCP card, available with the family for counselling the mother and 
caregivers on breastfeeding. 
You should reinforce the following key messages to promote breastfeeding amongst the mother/
caregivers:
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,26,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child26
• Early initiation of breastfeeding immediately after birth or definitely within 
1 hour of birth provides ‘colostrum’ (mother’s first milk) to the newborn that 
helps in fighting diseases. Colostrum- the first thick yellowish milk is essential for 
the newborn’s nutrition and protection against infections and diseases. This also 
encourages flow of breastmilk, keeps the newborn warm and promotes bonding between the mother and the newborn. 
• You may remind the parents that breastmilk helps in better growth of the brain, ensures proper development 
and improves intelligence, protects against dangerous illnesses, protects 
against obesity, hypertension (blood pressure), diabetes mellitus, etc. during 
adulthood.
• Mother should breastfeed as often as the child wants in day and night. 
Frequent feeding helps mothers to produce more breastmilk.
• Mother should continue breastfeeding even during diarrhoea or any other illnesses to help the child to get optimal nutrition and recover from the illness faster. 
• Breast feeding mother should eat extra and drink plenty of fluids to provide adequate milk for the child during this time. 
• Mother should pay attention to/observe early signs of hunger in the child like restlessness, opening mouth and turning head from side to side, putting tongue 
in and out and sucking on fingers or fists. Crying is a late sign of hunger. Mother 
should smile, talk and look into child’s eyes while breastfeeding, encouraging the child to communicate (but not rock the child while breastfeeding). 
Counsel and reassure the mother in busting the myth that she does not have 
enough milk for the growing child. Almost all mothers produce enough 
breast milk for one or even two children up to 6 months of age. Usually, even when a mother thinks that she does not have enough breast milk, her child is in fact getting all that she/he needs. Build her confidence and support her to breastfeed by increasing the number of times she feeds the child. She should also be advised to take adequate rest.
Support the mother in recovering 
from childbirth and advocate to the family members the importance of adequate rest and nutrition for the mother. Also, encourage the family to support the mother by sharing 
her workload so that she can successfully breastfeed her 
child. 
Mothers also resume work during this time. You can counsel 
them to feed the child before going and after coming back. 
Also suggest these mothers to express milk for the day which 
can be given to the child by other caregivers.
"

Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child27
discourage the mother/family from: 
• Giving top feeds (other than breast milk like animal milk, 
powdered milk, etc.) during the first six months. 
• Giving additional food or fluid, herbal water, honey, glucose 
water, ghutti water, plain water, animal or powdered milk, etc. during the first six months. 
• Using bottles and teats (a plastic nipple used on top of the bottle) for feeding the child as they are harmful and are likely to carry infections. 

4.1.4 ENSURING BREASTFEEDING OF L OW BIRTH  WEIGHT (LBW) AND   
SICK INFANTS
You know that infants with less than 2.5 kg body 
weight (or birth weight less than 2500 grams) are 
low birth weight infants. LBW infants, sick infants and 
malnourished children have higher risk of early growth retardation, infectious disease, developmental delay and death during infancy and childhood. Such children are 
usually treated in facilities like SNCUs, NBSUs and NRC 
as they need specialised healthcare by trained service 
providers. 
You need to explain that low birth weight, sick and malnourished infants may have feeding difficulties 
initially because they are weak or sick, get tired easily and thus their intake is poor. They may also have additional problems like difficulty in swallowing, vomiting, or abdominal distension.
During your home visits to families having sick children, 
LBW infants and malnourished children, explain the 
mother/caregiver that these children have higher nutritional needs than normal children. Explain the 
mothers/caregivers to:
• Breastfeed several times a day, every two-three hours, 
even during the night. 
• Stroke on sides of the lips and the upper part of the chin to wake up a sleeping child for feeding. 
• Feed expressed breast milk (EBM) using a cup, katori, paladai and spoon in 
case they are unable to feed directly from the breast. 
• Put to breast to allow them to lick the nipple and try to suckle. Once 
the child is able to suckle, child should be put to the breast as often as possible to stimulate milk production. 
• Use Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) to prevent hypothermia; KMC 
provides skin-to-skin contact, warmth and closeness to the 
mother’s breast. Fathers can also practice Kangaroo Care.

4.2 ComPlement ArY FeedinG
4.2.1 COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING- WHY START COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING ON 
COMPLETION OF SIx MONTHS OF AGE AND CONTINUE BREASTFEEDING?
Children should be introduced to semi-solid, soft foods (complementary 
feeding) on completion of six months of age because:
• Breast milk alone is not sufficient to meet the growing needs of the 
child. 
• 6 months to 24 months is a period of rapid growth and development 
in the young child and demands extra nutrition. 
Breastfeeding should be continued:
• For a minimum of 2 years or beyond because it is an 
important source of nutrition, provides energy and 
protection from illness. 
• It protects infants from infection, who are particularly vulnerable during the transition period when complementary feeding begins.
Breastfeeding Complementary 
feeding
remember 
• To counsel that all children- both girls and boys from birth to 6 months need to be breastfed on demand, both day and 
night-at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. 
• To use your skills learnt during your training in ASHA 
Module-6 and 7, to correct the position for breastfeeding, address common breastfeeding problems and common 
reasons for decreased/stopping breastfeeding, teaching 
expressing milk by hand and feeding the expressed milk. 
• To reassure the family members and seek their support for the mother in providing additional care to low birth weight baby. 
• To advise mother regarding storage of Expressed Breast Milk (EBM):
 ¾Can be kept in a covered container at room temperature for up to 6 hours. 
 ¾Milk not fed to the infant within 6 hours of expressing should be discarded.
 ¾Can be stored in the main compartment of a regular refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) for 24 hours.
During your home visits, ensure that the mother continues to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months."

4.2.2 REQUIREMENTS OF COMPLEMENTARY FOODS
1. timely
Introduced at completion of six months when requirement for energy and nutrients exceeds that 
provided by breastmilk alone.
2. Adequate
Should provide sufficient nutrients to meet the growing needs of 
the child- energy, protein, vitamins and minerals from different food groups like cereals such as wheat, wheat flour (atta/maida), rice, 
rice flakes (chirwa), maize/ corn, barley, semolina (suji), vermicelli 
(sevian), puffed rice (murmura), etc. and millets like bajra, ragi, jowar, etc. and pulses (daals) and legumes such as channa daal, besan, 
moong daal, arhar daal/tur daal, white/black/green chana, lobia,

liver, fish, poultry, eggs (well-cooked), etc.); and ghee/butter/cooking oil and sugar/jaggery (gur) and nuts. Roasted, crushed and powdered/mashed groundnuts can be added to the food (only if 
the child is not allergic).
3. Properly Fed 
Active feeding method to encourage the child to eat more without forced 
feeding. Children have small stomach therefore should be fed more frequently. Feed children from a separate cup/katori/plate at recommended frequency (Table 3).
4. safe
Food should be hygienically prepared and stored. Mothers/caregivers 
should wash their hands with soap and water before preparing food and 
feeding the child. Also wash the child’s hands.

• Decrease the intake or output of breast milk 
resulting in a low nutrient diet
• Increase risk of illness especially diarrhoea• Growth and development slows down or stops- physical and brain growth faltering*
• Risk of deficiencies and infectious diseases
*Growth faltering means the child does not grow in an age appropriate manner in terms of weight and length/height.

4.2.3 A SSESSING INFORMATION ABOUT COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING FROM THE 
MOTHER/CAREGIVER 
• start by asking if the mother/caregiver is breastfeeding the child?
 ¾How many times in a day- both day and night?
 ¾Is the child breast fed at night? If yes, how many times is the child fed at night.
• Does the child take any other food or fluids?
 ¾What foods or fluids?
 ¾How many times per day?
 ¾Are the foods thick or thin?
 ¾What do you use to feed the child?Figure 2: Different consistencies of Complementary Food Table 3: Five important things to remember about Complementary Feeding
Consistency Quantity Frequency density Variety
• Depends on age of the child 
and readiness to chew and 
swallow. 
• Initially include soft and mashed foods. 
• Move gradually to foods with appropriate thick consistency. 
• Give Daal (& not Daal ka Paani)
• Feed prepared should not 
be too thin and too thick. 
Test: stays on a spoon when the spoon is tilted (see figure given below)• Increase with 
the age of the 
child. 
• Encourage for better intake but 
not force child to 
eat more.
• At one-year, child should receive half the mother’s 
nutrition. • Increase with 
the age of the 
child. 
• Number of feeds will increase 
gradually with 
increase in age of the child. • Add a spoon 
of some 
edible oils or fats/
ghee/butter; 
sugar/jaggery (gur) to each feed, 
to make the 
feed rich in energy.• Add fruits and 
vegetables- The 
rule is that the 
greener it is, 
or the more red and yellow 
is the feed, 
the more is 
the protective 
quality. 
• Meat, egg (well-cooked), poultry, fish, etc. are liked by children and are also very nutritive and protective. 
thick food stays on the spoon.
Thin food fills 
the stomach but 
does not provide 
sufficient energy."

 ¾How large are the servings (cup/katori, teaspoon, tablespoon)?
 ¾Does the child receive separate serving from the family members?
 ¾Who feeds the child and how?
 ¾What feeding difficulties does mother/caregiver experience, if any?
• Ask if the child’s feeding has changed during the illness?
 ¾If yes, how?
The mother’s/caregiver’s answers to these questions will give you an idea whether the child is 
receiving adequate amount of nutrition from breastfeeding and complementary feeding. You should 
counsel for continuation of breastfeeding during the home visits, support them in maintaining age- 
appropriate feeding pattern by counselling on what should be avoided and teach right quantities for complementary feeds. It is also important to inform them about feeding during illness and recovery 
phase and regarding specific nutritional needs of malnourished children.
4.2.4 IMPORTANT MESSAGES FOR MOTHERS AND CAREGIVERS ON 
COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING
• Combination of pulses (daals) and legumes with cereals and millets 
should be given. Example- daal with rice or cracked wheat porridge (dalia) with daal, chappati/roti soaked in daal, bajra khichri with daal, 
etc. Feed should be prepared from locally available pulses and cereals/
millets. 
• Oil/ghee/butter, sugar/jaggery (gur), roasted crushed and powdered/mashed groundnut (if the child is not allergic) etc. can be added to the feed for making it rich, tasty and easy to swallow. Do not add spices to the food of the child.
• Locally available, fresh and seasonal fruits and vegetables should be given to the child. Washed, cooked and mashed fruits and vegetables can be added to the feed. 
• Cereals/millets and pulses that are soaked, sprouted, dry roasted and powdered for cooking can be given to the child as they are easily digested. 
• Animal products/non-vegetarian foods (meat, liver, fish, poultry, 
eggs (well-cooked), etc.), wherever culturally acceptable, can be started as early and given as often possible to the child. 
• Plan for one to two healthy snacks in between the main meals. Snacks 
are like small meals which are given in between main meals. These 
must not  be a replacement of meals. Mashed fruits like banana, papaya, mango, cheeku and other 
soft fruits; boiled and mashed potatoes, mashed vegetables, well-cooked eggs, curd, panjeeri, laddoo, halwa, upma, idli, poha with crushed/mashed groundnuts (do not add groundnuts if child is allergic), etc. are some of the examples of food items to be given as snack to the child.

• Introduce only one food at a time, variety can be increased by adding new foods one by one. 
• Show interest, smile or play games to encourage children to eat enough food. 
• Continue complementary feeding during illness and increase the amount during the recovery 
period. 
• Feed the child in a separate cup/katori/plate as it will help mother/caregivers to understand the quantity of food eaten by the child. 
• If the child dislikes a particular food, remove it from the diet for some time and give again at a later stage.
• Complementary foods should be prepared hygienically. Mothers/
caregivers must wash their hands 
before preparing and before feeding the child. The child’s hands should be washed also. Clean utensils should be used to prepare the feed of the child. 
• Girls and boys have the same nutrition requirement to grow and develop. So they both should be 
given the same amount and similar kind of food. 
4.2.5 INFORMING MOTHERS AND CAREGIVERS WHAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN 
COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING
It is also important to explain mothers/caregivers to avoid :
• Ready-made or processed food available in the market such 
as toffees, sweets, chips, chocolates, biscuits, namkeens; drinks such as tea, coffee, cola drinks, cold drinks, fruit juices, 
sharbats, etc. 
• Showing personal dislikes for any food item otherwise child 
will not learn to eat all types of foods. 
• Food which can pose choking hazard such as whole nuts, grapes, raw carrot pieces, etc. initially. These should be given 
only at a later stage when the chewing and swallowing ability has been fully developed. 
4.2.6 SOME USEFUL HOUSEHOLD MEASUREMENTS FOR PREPARING FEEDS FOR 
THE CHILD
Age-appropriate feeding recommendations on complementary feeding at completion of 6 months 
to 12 months and beyond is given the MCP card, page number 11. Refer to this, while counselling 
mothers/caregivers regarding complementary feeding.

Figure 3: Common household measurement of a cup/katori
1/2 (half) cup/katori 3/4th cup/katori 1 full cup/katori 
(250ml)*The quantity mentioned may be difficult for a family to measure correctly. The size of cup/katori, 
serving spoon/karchi, teaspoon and tablespoon can vary in size and shape. Thus, it is important to 
explain the mother and caregiver about the quantity by showing common household utensils that 
are used in the family for serving food. 
household measurements of commonly used household utensils:
• 1 full cup/katori*= 250 ml (the volume may vary) 
• 1 serving spoon/karchi= 100 ml (the volume can vary) 
• 1 teaspoon- 5 ml
• 1 tablespoon- 15 ml
With the child’s bowl, it can be easy to demonstrate how much is 1/2 (half), 3/4th, and a full cup/
katori as shown in the figure given below.
(1 teaspoon = 5ml)
(1 tablespoon=15ml)
Complementary Feeding- Quantity and Frequency for the Child
• Breastfeed as often as the child wants and continue breastfeeding if the 
child is sick. 
At 6 months - On completion of 6 
months, start feeding 2-3 tablespoons at each meal of soft, well-mashed foods, 2-3 times each day.
From 6 months upto 9 months-2-3 tablespoons to be gradually increased to half (1/2) cup/katori at each meal of mashed food, 2-3 times each day and 1-2 snacks. 
From 9 months upto 12 months-Atleast half (1/2) cup/katori at each meal of finely chopped or mashed food and foods that the baby can pick up with her/his fingers, 3-4 
times each day and 1-2 snacks.

4.2.8 FEEDING OF SICK AND MALNOURISHED CHILD
Timely initiation of complementary feeding along with responsive feeding are 
also important for sick and malnourished children. The messages given above on 
complementary feeding are also useful for these children. During this time, the 
child may not want to eat much, but children need small frequent meals and more fluids, including breastmilk and other liquids to recover more quickly during illness. Children who are breastfeeding, need to be breastfed more often and for longer time. 
After an illness, children should be given more food and more often than usual for at 
least 2 weeks to help recover from the weight lost during illness. 
4.2.9 R OLE OF ASHA IN PROMOTING BREASTFEEDING AND COMPLEMENTARY FEEDING
You may use the MCP card, Page 8, to ensure that activities related to breastfeeding and complementary feeding are undertaken during the home visits. Also, with reference to MCP card, pages- 10 and 11, 
4.2.7 FEEDING THE CHILD RESPONSIVELY 
Mothers/caregivers should recognize the signs of hunger and respond as soon as possible. Responsive feeding means gently encouraging—not 
forcing—the child to eat.
Counsel the mothers/caregivers to: 
1. Be patient in feeding the child and encourage them to eat. Do not 
force the child to eat. 
2. Try different food combinations, tastes and methods to encourage feeding if children refuse 
many foods. 
3. Play games to help the child to eat enough food and to encourage the child to try new foods. 
4. Minimize any disturbances - during meals, if the child loses interest easily.
5. Smile and talk to children during feeding, with eye to eye contact as feeding times are periods of learning and affection. 
6. Do not express anger at children who refuse to eat. These actions usually 
result in children eating less.
From 12 months upto 2 
years- Introduce family foods, 
chopped or mashed, give ¾ to 1 
full cup/katori at each meal, 3-4 times each day and 1-2 snacks.
For 2 years and older children, give a variety of family foods to the child, at least 1 full cup/katori 
(250ml) at each meal, 3-4 meals each day with 1-2 nutritious snacks between meals.

messages related to early and exclusive breastfeeding and age- appropriate complementary feeding, 
respectively can be explained to the mother/caregiver. During each home visit from 3 months up to 
15 months, you will:
• Encourage the mother/caregiver to exclusively breastfeed the child from birth to 6 months and 
provide complementary feeding on completion of 6 months of age, to girl and boy children alike. 
• Ensure support from family members-
husband, mother and father in-law, etc. for the mother to provide her sufficient 
rest and adequate nutrition to breastfeed 
her child. Family support is required to feed the child responsively. 
• Provide counselling to mother/caregivers 
on importance of early and exclusive breastfeeding and timely introduction of age-appropriate complementary feeding to the child. Ensure that families having children- low 
birth weight, malnourished, sick, those discharged from SNCU/NBSU/NRC, etc. are counselled 
and following your advice. 
• Undertake joint visits with ASHA Facilitator or ANM/MPW to a household where you are unable 
to convince the family for exclusive breastfeeding/complementary feeding. 
• Educate regarding the importance of regular hand-washing before and after preparing food, before feeding the child and after using the toilet. 
• Mobilise the lactating mothers and their 
children for registration at the nearby Anganwadi centre to receive ‘Take Home 
Ration’ (THR) for themselves and their 
children beyond 6 months of age. 
• Refer mothers with problems in breastfeeding 
and those children who are unable to take breastfeed or complementary feed to ANM at Sub-Centre (SC) or trained medical specialist 
at nearest health facility for appropriate care. 
Follow-up with them closely to ensure child is provided appropriate care and is growing well. 
As an ASHA, you can mobilise support from VHSNC/MAS, VHNDs/UHNDs, self-help group meetings, 
mother’s group meetings, support groups, etc. for promotion and counselling activities related to 
breastfeeding and complementary feeding. These groups can also help you in overcoming the harmful 
traditional practices and beliefs related to young child feeding and nutrition prevalent amongst mothers- 
in- law, fathers- in-law, husband and other family members.

4.3. iron And F oliC ACid sUPPlement Ation
In ASHA Module- 6, you have been trained in management of anaemia among women. In this section, 
you will learn that anaemia is also a common problem among children in India.
4.3.1 WHAT IS ANAEMIA ?
Anaemia is a condition when there is low haemoglobin level in the body resulting in less ability to carry oxygen to all parts of the body.
Anaemia in children occurs when the haemoglobin level in the body is 
less than 11 g/dl.
Anaemia in children causes poor learning ability, low concentration, 
tiredness, poor school performance and poor coordination of language. The child is unable to reach his/her full potential both physically and 
mentally.
4.3.2 CAUSES OF NUTRITIONAL ANAEMIA IN CHILDREN
Breastmilk is sufficient to meet the iron requirement of a breastfed child until 6 months of age. Iron 
from breast milk is more easily available to the young child. The onset of anaemia in young children 
is generally after 6 months of age and increases from 6–8 months till the child is 1 year old. The 
common causes of nutritional anaemia are:
• Low iron stores at birth due to anaemia in mother.
• Non-exclusive breastfeeding up to 6 months of age.
• Too early introduction of inappropriate complementary food i.e. before completion of 6 months 
of age (resulting in diminished breast milk intake, insufficient iron intake, and heightened risk of 
intestinal infections).
• Late introduction of appropriate (iron-rich) complementary foods i.e. later than completion of 6 
months of age.
• Insufficient quantity of iron and iron enhancers in diet (foods rich in Vitamin C) and low availability of dietary iron (especially from vegetarian diet).
• Iron loss due to parasite load (e.g. malaria, intestinal worms).
• Poor environmental sanitation, unsafe drinking water and inadequate personal hygiene leading to frequent illnesses.

To overcome this problem, government has launched Anemia Mukt Bharat campaign recently to 
promote Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation for prevention of anaemia in all children 6-59 
months of age. The dose and regime of IFA supplementation and deworming under the programme 
is explained in this chapter.

*IFA syrup should noT  be given in children suffering from acute illness (fever, diarrhoea, pneumonia, etc.). Mother/caregiver 
should be advised to continue subsequent doses of IFA supplementation as soon as the child recovers from these illnesses. It is 
also not to be provided in children suffering from thalassemia major and in those with history of repeated blood transfusion. 
The IFA supplementation in severely acute malnourished (SAM) children, should be continued as per management protocol for 
SAM management provided by NRC or Primary Health Centre (PHC/UPHC) Medical Officer.Table 5: Dose and regime for Iron Folic Acid supplementation for prevention of anaemia*

• You will be provided 50 ml IFA syrup bottle (with auto-dispenser) from PHC/Sub-centre; 2 
bottles/ child/year (in first year of child, one 50 ml bottle will be required). You will write the date of giving the IFA syrup bottle to the mother/caregiver in the compliance card as given on 
page 27 in the MCP card.
• The IFA syrup bottles have an auto-dispenser so that only 1 ml of syrup will be dispensed at a 
time (having the required dosage for children).
• You can provide the 50 ml IFA syrup bottle (with auto-dispenser) to mothers/caregivers during home visits or utilize the platform of VHND/UHND or other dedicated rounds such as Vitamin A round, etc.
• Albendazole tablets will be provided to children for biannual deworming, with dose as given in the table above (once in 6 months) during the National Deworming Day (10th February and 10th August every year). Under this strategy, under-five children, out-of school children and adolescents are provided deworming tablet at Anganwadi centres by AWWs, whereas school- going children and adolescents are provided the deworming treatment through school platform. 
The date of administration of albendazole to the child will be entered by ANM/MPW as given on 
Page 27 in the MCP card.
Fortified Foods
Food fortification refers to the addition of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals required in 
small amounts for development) in a food so as to improve the nutritional quality of food at very reasonable cost and to provide public health benefit with minimal risk to health. Fortified food is a food which has undergone the process of fortification as per regulations. The Government of India has mandated the use of fortified salt, wheat flour and oil in foods served under Integrated 
Child Development Services (ICDS) and Mid-day Meal (MDM) schemes 
to address micronutrient deficiencies. In addition, all health facility-based programmes where food is being provided are mandated to provide fortified wheat, rice (with iron, folic acid and vitamin B12), and 
double fortified salt (with iodine and iron), and oil (with vitamin A and 
D) as per standards for fortification of staple foods (salt, wheat, rice, milk and oil) prescribed and notified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI, 2016).

• Demonstrate to the mothers/caregivers to provide IFA syrup through the auto- dispenser bottle. 
Follow these steps for giving IFA syrup:
a. Child must be held in the mother’s/caregiver’s lap. 
b. Encourage the child to open the mouth. 
c. If the child does not open the mouth, press the 
cheeks gently together for the mouth to open.
d. Shake the IFA syrup bottle well before use. 
Explain the mother/caregiver that the entire 
dose of IFA syrup should be administered into the child’s mouth and watch the child swallow the entire dose.
e. Explain the mother/caregiver that child should be administered IFA syrup only on fixed days on a biweekly basis (preferably Wednesday and Saturday). 
f. IFA should be given at least one hour after consumption of food (breastfed/ given semi-solid food/solid food).
g. Mark a tick (√) in the compliance card as given on page 27 in the MCP card after giving the dose for the month-wise bi-weekly IFA syrup supplementation. 
• Undertake fortnightly home visits from the second week onwards up to the month end (the remaining 6 doses for the month), and encourage the mothers/caregivers to administer IFA syrup to their child themselves in your presence. This would help in confidence building of the mothers/caregivers in providing IFA syrup to her child. 
• Explain the mother/caregiver to record compliance by marking a tick (√) in the compliance card as given on page 27 in the MCP card, in the month-wise bi-weekly IFA syrup supplementation section after giving every dose of iron folic acid syrup. After a month, the mothers/caregivers would acquire the required skills and confidence in providing IFA syrup to their child twice a week and marking the same in the compliance card.
• Regularly motivate the families who refuse to provide IFA syrup and albendazole tablets to their children. Undertake joint visits with ASHA Facilitator or ANM/MPW to difficult households where you are unable to convince the family for biweekly IFA supplementation and biannual deworming for children.
• During the home visits, counsel the mothers and caregivers about:
 ¾Free availability of IFA syrup and deworming tablets at public health facilities and Anganwadi Centres. 
 ¾Benefit of IFA syrup for their child, improving iron and folate content of the diets and the importance of sanitation and hygienic practices in order to prevent anaemia and worm infestation in the child.FREEWant a

 ¾Importance of providing the IFA supplementation and biannual deworming in children; its 
positive impact on physical and mental development of the child e.g. improvement in well-being, attentiveness in studies and intelligence, etc.
 ¾Minor side effects associated with IFA administration such as black discolouration of stools.
 ¾Preservation of IFA bottle – in a cool and dark place, away from reach of children, keeping the lid of the bottle tightly closed each time after administration, etc.
 ¾Immediately contacting the ANM/MPW in case of any problem after consumption of iron folic acid syrup by the child.
 ¾Informing them to contact either you or the ANM/MPW for a new IFA syrup bottle if the bottle finishes.
• Monitor that the mother/caregiver has given IFA syrup to the child (by looking at the tick (√) in the MCP card on page 27).
• Encourage the mother/caregivers to 
include iron-rich and folic acid-rich 
foods in the diet of the child-dark green leafy vegetables like mustard leaves (sarson saag), drumstick, turnip leaves, fenugreek (methi), bathua, mint 
(pudina), amaranth (chaulai), spinach 
(palak), spring onion, colocasia (arbi) leaves, etc. ; ragi, whole wheat flour, pumpkin, raw banana (plantain banana), pulses (daals), legumes (rajmah, lobia, soyabean, black chickpeas (kala chana), jaggery (gur), fresh peas, fresh beans, nuts, dry dates, raisins, sesame (til) seeds, animal foods/non-vegetarian sources like meat, liver, poultry, egg, fish, etc.
• Advice to include foods containing Vitamin C like cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, watermelon, 
guava, orange, lemon, gooseberry (amla), sweet lime (mosambi), etc. and animal foods- meat, 
poultry, fish, liver, egg, etc., fermented and sprouted foods (grains and pulses), etc. as these increase the absorption of iron. Iron and folic acid fortified foods can also be included in the diet wherever available.

You have been trained regarding Family Planning- couples (women and men) needs for family 
planning and types of family planning methods and information on each method’s side-effects in detail in ASHA Module-7. This section is intended to serve as a refresher, and builds on your existing 
knowledge.
Under HBNC visits, you have been maintaining and updating the list of eligible couples, lactating 
mothers, children below 5 years of age in your community in the health register, counselling the 
mother after delivery regarding the need of contraceptive services, reinforcing the concept of 
healthy timing and spacing of births, enabling them to make an informed choice, and ensuring access to contraceptive services. 
There are chances of conception after delivery amongst:
• Exclusively breastfeeding women as early as 6 months 
• Women who are not exclusively breastfeeding 
women- giving top feeding/water/honey/ghutti, etc. as early as 6 weeks 
• Non-breastfeeding women as early as 4 weeks and 
• Women who have/had an abortion within 10 days 
You are aware of the different methods available for family 
planning. Some of these are a part of your kit which should be replenished from nearest health facility/ANM/MPW

2. Permanent methods (limiting methods)- Female sterilization 
and Male sterilization. Remember that female sterilization can also 
be adopted immediately or within 7 days of delivery/ completion of abortion (called as post-partum/ post-abortion sterilization) whereas male sterilization can be adopted anytime. 
3. emergency Contraceptive Pill (ezy pill)- This is not a regular method of contraception. It must 
be consumed within 72 hours (the earlier, the better) in cases of unplanned/ unprotected/ forced 
intercourse or accidental breaking/ slipping of the condom. 
You are being incentivized for ensuring spacing of 3 years after the birth of 1st child and in case 
the couple opts for permanent limiting method after 2 children. Additionally, you are incentivized for counselling and escorting the client for Postpartum IUCD (PPIUCD)/Post Abortion IUCD 
(PAIUCD) insertion.
5.1.2 DURING YOUR HOME VISITS, YOU WILL COUNSEL THE COUPLES ON FAMILY 
PLANNING 
• Explain the risk of unprotected sex and high chances of conceiving. Mention that return of 
fertility is uncertain and women can conceive even before their menses/periods return.
• Counsel couples to maintain spacing of 3 years between two children for the health of both mother and child.
• Counsel the couple on available basket of contraceptive choices under the National Family Planning Program for spacing and limiting births. 
• Counsel couples for adoption of appropriate family planning methods in post-partum/ post abortion period.
• Deliver contraceptives like Nirodh (condoms), Mala-N, Chhaya and Ezy pills at the doorstep of 
beneficiaries. 
• Inform the couples about availability of all contraceptives services free of cost in the public health 
facilities.
• Escort the woman to health facility if she chooses to adopt PPIUCD/PAIUCD services or sterilization services.Female Sterilization
 Male Sterilization
remember
Of all the contraceptive methods available, COCs (Mala- N) should not  be taken by women 
who are breastfeeding till six months after delivery as it affects the quantity and quality of 
breastmilk. Centchroman pills (Chhaya) and POPs can be started anytime after delivery once 
woman is comfortable. Injectable MPA (Antara Programme) can be taken by women after 6 
weeks of delivery and IUCD can be inserted immediately or within 48 hours of vaginal delivery 
(and immediately after Caesarean section). Thereafter, IUCD can be inserted beyond 6 weeks of delivery. IUCD can also be inserted within 12 days of completion of abortion. All other spacing contraceptives can be started immediately or within 7 days of completion of abortion."

• Inform the couple to contact you or other healthcare providers to seek information 
regarding available methods and help them choose a method that is most suitable to them.
During your home visits, counsel the couple on the importance of family planning and maintaining healthy timing and spacing of birth, also inform them regarding the availability of wide range of contraceptive methods and help them make suitable choices of these methods.
5.2 FUll immUniZA tion F or Children  
Immunization, has been covered in detail as part of your training in ASHA 
Module- 7. You are actively involved in Mission Indradhanush (MI) for 
improving the immunization coverage of your area. This section will provide an update on new vaccines introduced as part of the National Immunization Schedule and will be a recapitulation of your roles in improving uptake of 
immunization services as part of your household visits. 
5.2.1 N ATIONAL IMMUNIzATION SCHEDULE
Page 36 of the MCP card provides detail of National 
Immunization Schedule for children at birth to 9 months of age and page 37 of the MCP card provides details for 
children from 16-24 months to 16 years of age. 
ANM/MPW will fill the details- date of vaccination and 
also write the next vaccination date in the MCP card and 
will return the card to the mother. You may refer to the 
MCP card, page 36 to check the immunization status of the child during the household visits from 3rd month to 
15 months of age and use the Immunization Essentials 
as given on page number 38, to understand the updated immunization schedule of vaccination from birth to 1
1/2 
years of age.
5.2.2 POSSIBLE REASONS FOR LOW 
IMMUNIzATION COVERAGE
To address the gaps in improving population coverage it is important to understand the possible 
reasons for low immunization coverage. From your experience you will know that some of these 
possible reasons are- 
• Lack of awareness of benefits of routine immunization-  Families/caregivers are unaware 
regarding the benefits of Routine Immunization (RI). 
• Failure to organize immunization camps- At planned outreach site (anganwadi centre during 
monthly VHND/UHND), Sub-centre (SC) or Primary Health Centre (PHC)/Urban Primary Health 
Centre (UPHC) sites due to shortage of frontline staff.

• lack of information-  The healthcare providers have not informed the families/caregivers about 
what vaccines are due, when they are due and why they are needed. 
• drop-outs- Children who receive one or more vaccination, but do not return for subsequent 
doses. Often families migrate for livelihood and children belonging to these families miss out on vaccination. 
• Unreached population-  There are usually the vulnerable or marginalised populations (the 
categories belonging to such families has been taught in social vulnerability section) who do not know about immunization or face socio-economic barriers to utilize health services. 
• Geographic barrier-  People living too far away from a health centre or outreach site are unable 
to travel long distances and face challenges in completing a full immunization schedule for children.
• resistant population-  Families do not believe in immunization services, even though a health 
centre is within reach, as there is fear of side effects, etc. 
• missed opportunities-  Seen in case of children who visit the health centre for some other reason 
but are not screened for immunization by health workers.
• Cultural or religious reasons- There is refusal of vaccination due to myths, rumors and misconceptions prevalent in few sections of the society.
• Gender barrier- Sometimes women are not allowed to attend sessions by their family members. Also, if it is a girl child, family members may not give importance to her vaccination. 
• Financial barrier-  Sometimes families do not attend immunization sessions because of wage 
loss, etc.
• Fear of Adverse effects Following immunization (Ae Fi)- Fear of AEFI is also a major cause of 
refusal of vaccines. 
5.2.3 R OLE OF ASHA IN IMPROVING IMMUNIzATION COVERAGE
• Continue to enumerate all households in your service area and make a list of children up to two years eligible for different vaccines. Update this list regularly to ensure inclusion of new families having children 
below 15 months of age. 
• Check the immunization status of the child from the MCP card- 
whether child has received age-appropriate vaccines during the home visits. 
• Praise and encourage the family for ensuring their child’s immunization 
if all necessary vaccines have been given. Identify family constraints/
reasons for missed immunization and support or counsel to address 
the same. 
• Inform when and where the family can take the child for the next vaccination, for a missed vaccine, 
or if a vaccine is due soon.

Address common concerns related to immunization
You need to counsel mothers and caregivers that- 
• A mild illness is usually not a reason to reschedule vaccinations 
• The child may still be vaccinated even if he or she has: 
  A low-grade fever (less than 100 degrees) 
  A cold, runny nose or cough 
  Ear infection 
  Mild diarrhoea 
•  ANM/MPW or the Medical Officer at PHC or UPHC can determine if the child can be vaccinated 
in case of mild illness.
• After a vaccination, the child may cry a little, but that usually settles soon with a feed or some comfort provided by the family member. 
• Common, minor side-effects such as a slight fever, pain, swelling or redness at the site of the injection and irritability are normal and usually resolve without any serious consequences. Extra fluids, rest and paracetamol medicine when necessary helps the child recover soon from the effects of immunization. However, if other reactions or changes in the child’s body are noted, it is a matter of concern, and the child must be referred immediately to the health facility. • Pay special attention to include children from families who are vulnerable or marginalised, sick, LBW and malnourished infants. Joint visits may be undertaken with ASHA Facilitators and ANMs/MPW to mobilize these children for immunization. 
• Ensure effective mobilization of children for immunization sessions during VHND/UHND session or at the health facilities. This can be achieved by- 
 ¾  Escorting the mother/caregiver and child to the session/health centre for immunization, if required. This may be required for families living in remote areas or those 
having sick children, malnourished children, girl child, 
etc. 
 ¾  VHSNC/MAS members playing an important role to motivate resistant families for immunization. Initiate community level action to enable positioning of ANM/MPW and AWW in sub-centres/AWCs in hamlets or urban slums/basti which do have these frontline functionaries. 
A Routine Immunization Counterfoil, as given on Page 39 and 40 in the MCP card, enlists the date of 
vaccination from birth to 16 years of age, which is to be kept with the ANM/MPW to maintain the child’s record.
During each visit, check the immunization status of the child in the MCP card to ensure that child 
is up to date as per the immunization schedule. "

5.3 Gro Wth monitorinG 
Weight and length/height are the commonly used growth measurements in children. Length is 
recorded for children less than 2 years of age and height for children above 2 years of age. Growth 
is measured in terms of changes in weight with respect to age, length or height of children. Growth 
monitoring helps in visualising change in weight over a period of time with respect to age, length/height of the child and helps to identify if the child is growing adequately or not. Recording of child’s 
weight should be done once every month up to age of 3 years and at least once in 3 months, thereafter. 
Length is to be recorded once in three months from birth to 2 years of age and height once in 6 
months (2 years to 5 years of age). There are separate growth charts for girls and boys, as they have 
different weights and lengths/heights beginning at birth and grow to different sizes according to age. These are available in the MCP card.
These changes are useful in giving advice to the mother about the growing pattern of the child. This 
process is called ‘GROWTH MONITORING’. You are already familiar with growth monitoring from your training in ASHA Module 7. 
Optimal growth and development of the child can be 
ensured only with adequate food, absence of illness and a caring, nurturing and social environment. 
Maximum growth happens in the first two years of 
life. A healthy child approximately doubles the birth weight at 5th month and is three times the birth 
weight by the first birthday. By the end of second 
year, the weight is 4 times the birth weight. We must 
understand that weight gain is not the only way to 
assess a child’s growth. Increase in length or height of the child is also included in the growth pattern of the 
child. However, changes in child’s length are slower 
than the weight. At the time of birth, the baby’s length is around 50 cm. Expected gain in length in the first 
year after birth is 25 cms and in the second year is 12 
cms, contributing to a total increase of 37 cms length/
height in the first two years of life.
The A WW uses the growth chart for monitoring growth for every child, separately available for girls 
and boys. Every child in the village, should be weighed and her/his weight be plotted on the growth 
chart according to the age of the child. In addition, the length/height of the child will also be recorded 
in the growth chart given for weight-for-length/height. The AWW will be responsible for recording weight and length/height of the child during VHNDs/UHNDs, or the ANM/MPW can also record the 
weight and length/height of the child in the SC or during outreach sessions.
As part of your HBYC visits, you need to ensure that the weight and length/height of the child is 
recorded by the AWW and details are made available to the mother/caregiver by the AWW either 28 29

in MCP card or other mechanism as specified by your district or State. If the weight and/or length/
height of the child is not recorded, you will mobilise and accompany the mother/caregiver to the 
nearest Anganwadi Centre (AWC) or SC for recording the weight and length/height of the child for 
ensuring growth monitoring. 
5.3.1 WHAT IS GROWTH FALTERING?
Growth faltering is the slowing or stopping of growth. It is a sign that something is wrong with the child and immediate action must be taken to restore growth. Monitoring or measuring growth 
regularly is important to see whether the child is growing properly. 
By joining the weight dots on the growth chart, the curve (called growth curve) on the growth chart 
can be understood. The direction of the growth curve indicates the progress of the child and is helpful in providing appropriate counselling and initiating necessary actions such as referral etc. for malnourished children. 
Table 7 – Interpretation of growth curve 
Good - Upward curve dangerous- Flat curve Very dangerous-
downward curve
The curve is moving upwards.
Indicates adequate weight 
gain for the age of the child. The child is growing well and is healthy. 
The curve is flat, but has not gone down to another colour band.
Indicates that the child is not gaining 
weight and is not growing adequately. This is called stagnation. The child needs extra attention of the mother. Also, the cause needs to be investigated. Talk to AWW/ ANM (MPW) immediately. Such children should be taken to a 24X7 PHC/UPHC or higher facility for a medical consultation.
The curve is moving down, into another colour band.
Indicates loss of weight. 
Talk to AWW/ANM (MPW) immediately. Child may be severely underweight and she/he needs urgent specialised medical care and immediate referral. 
Praise, and assess feeding to reinforce the good practices of the mother/caregiver.Review feeding, praise what she is doing well and identify feeding problems, if any and give appropriate feeding advice for bringing about change. Check for any episode of illness. Take corrective action. Follow-up for compliance.Follow- up after 5 days to ensure compliance.
You have already learnt in ASHA Module- 7, on how to check for nutritional oedema of both feet. To check for oedema (swelling due to fluid retention), grasp the foot so that it rests in your hand with your thumb on top of the foot. Press your thumb gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. The child has oedema if a pit (dent) remains in the foot when you lift your thumb. This is one of the ways to detect children with severe malnutrition in the community. Such children will require prompt hospitalisation in a centre which manages such children. This is often the District Hospital. "

5.3.2 ROLE OF ASHA IN PROMOTING GROWTH MONITORING-PREVENTIVE AND 
PROMOTIVE COMMUNITY LEVEL CARE
• Explain the family members regarding the importance of weighing and measuring length/height 
of the child regularly.
• Discuss the trend of growth of the child with the mother/caregiver during each of the  
home visits by looking at the MCP card or as communicated by the AWW. Provide  
counselling depending on the direction of the growth curve in the MCP card or as specified by  
the AWW.
•  Prioritise and list children who are underweight, wasted, low birth weight, not gained weight for 2 months, are not growing well or who are “at risk” of undernutrition due to frequent illnesses like fever, diarrhoea and acute respiratory infection; children with inadequate or insufficient 
dietary intake, mother with illness or those living in unhygienic conditions, etc., should also be 
weighed frequently for taking corrective and timely action. 
• Ensure early registration of all children soon after birth to 15 months of age at the nearest AWC to avail the child care services like supplementary nutritional support, growth monitoring and promotion, immunization, early child care, health check-up, referral services, etc. 
• Ensure that children from 6 months of age to 15 months are provided Take Home Ration (THR)
at the AWC. 
• Counsel the mother/caregiver regarding promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six 
months of a child’s life, age-appropriate complementary feeding practices for all children aged 6–24 months, importance of hand-washing, using clean drinking water and its storage, safe sanitation and hygiene practices, age-specific immunization, appropriate play and communication 
with the child, etc. for proper growth and development.
• Pay extra attention to malnourished children, sick children, low birth weight children, etc. and 
refer to the health facility for further management in case of growth faltering. Follow-up with mother/caregiver to ensure adherence to treatment plan suggested by health facilities for these children.
• Use platforms like VHSNC/MAS, VHND/UHND, camps, mother support groups, self-help groups, community meetings, etc. to disseminate the importance of growth monitoring and finding suitable measures for rehabilitation and management of the malnourished children. 
• Explore the option of using untied funds of VHSNC/MAS to meet the special care needs of malnourished children if required. 
During each visit, ensure that weight and length/height of the child is recorded by the AWW and details are made available for understanding the growth pattern of each child. "

5.4 mAn AGement oF siCK Child dUrinG home Visits
You have already learnt management of a sick child during 
your trainings in ASHA Module-7. This section will support in refreshing your knowledge and skills in management of young 
children who are suffering from common childhood illnesses 
such as Fever, Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) and Diarrhoea. You must assess the child for sickness during all the household visits under HBYC. 
5.4.1 INITIAL ASSESSMENT FOR DANGER SIGNS
1. identify problem-  If not reported by the mother/caregiver, 
ask whether the child is sick during all your home visits.
2. Assess all children with an illness for the presence of general danger signs: 
 • Not able to drink or breastfeed
 • Vomits everything
 • Has convulsions (fits)
 • Is lethargic or unconscious
 recall that these general danger signs indicate serious 
illness. These can occur in many illnesses. Some danger signs may occur without any relationship to the type 
of illness. For example-fever, diarrhoea, pneumonia, 
meningitis or malaria can all produce lethargy or unconsciousness. 
3. refer immediately, a child with any of the above 
danger signs. In addition to these general danger signs, there may be other signs like fast breathing, 
chest indrawing, stiff neck, etc. in other diseases that 
require immediate referral. 
Delay in availing healthcare services especially in case of sick girl child is a common practice seen in families. 
Families need to be especially counselled to avoid delay 
in providing treatment to the sick girl child to prevent worsening of the condition. Ensure that you also pay extra attention to children from vulnerable/marginalized households, low birth weight children, malnourished children, SNCU/NBSU/NRC discharged children, etc. as they are weak and are more prone to falling ill through repeated 
infections.

Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child52
You along with the ANM/MPW at community level will work together to protect, prevent and treat 
children below 15 months of age from common childhood illnesses discussed in this section. 
5.4.2 MANAGING FEVER 
You know that fever is a very common problem in young children. A child 
(2 months-5 years) has fever if the axillary temperature is 37.5 degree 
Celsius or above (99.5 degree Fahrenheit). A child with fever may have malaria or another disease such as simple cough or cold or other viral infection. Follow these steps if you come across a child suffering from fever during your home visits. 
1. measure the temperature of the child by placing the thermometer in 
the armpit of the sick child for 2 minutes if you find a child who appears 
to be sick or is warm. 
2. r efer urgently to the nearest health facility  if the fever has been 
present every day for more than seven days or if there are any general 
danger signs or stiffness of neck. 
3. Classify and provide appropriate management of fever as follows:

general danger signs.
• Advise caregivers on use of 
insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). 
• Follow up in two days if fever persists.
• If fever is present every day for more than seven days, refer the child.

Advise the mother/caregiver to-
• Feed the child during illness.
• Give extra fluids* -
 ¾Increase breast feeding.
 ¾Offer the child extra to drink (home fluids)- rice-pulse based drink, vegetable soup, green 
coconut water, milk, lemon drink, plain clean water, yoghurt drink, etc. (if child is above  
6 months of age).
5.4.3 MANAGING A CUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTION (ARI)
You may also come across children with cough and cold and/or difficulty in breathing during your 
household visits. These children are said to be suffering from Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI). 
Pneumonia, one of the most common ARI in children, is caused by certain germs, such as bacteria 
or viruses and affects the lungs. It can spread in a number of ways. The viruses and bacteria that are 
commonly found in a child’s nose or throat, can infect the lungs if they are inhaled. They may also spread via air-borne droplets from a cough or sneeze. In addition, pneumonia may spread through 
blood, especially during and shortly after birth. 
The MCP card, on page 9 provides details of identification of pneumonia and breath counts to identify 
pneumonia. Counsel mother/caregiver on identification of pneumonia using the MCP card during 
your home visits.
5.4.4 IDENTIFICATION OF PNEUMONIA
1. Coughing gets worse
2. Fast breathing
3. Chest indrawing 
4. Fever 
It can be identified by breath counts. 
Count the breaths in one minute to assess difficulty in breathing based 
on what you have learnt in earlier trainings. 
decide whether the child has normal breathing or fast breathing.

5.4.5 MANAGING DIARRHOEA 
You are aware that diarrhoea is the leading cause of deaths in children. You are also aware that 
a child is said to be suffering from diarrhoea if s/he is passing stool more than three times a day, which is usually watery. The normally frequent or semi-solid stools 
of a breastfed baby is not  diarrhoea. You need to follow these steps 
if you come across a child suffering from diarrhoea during your  
home visits-
1. Identify the nature of diarrhoea. 
2. Ask the mother about the duration of diarrhoea; if the diarrhoea 
is of 14 days or more, the child has severe persistent diarrhoea 
and needs to be referred to hospital. 
3. Refer if the child is passing blood in stools or is suffering from dysentery.
4. Assess for the classification of dehydration and administer appropriate treatment as per the 
table below. 
The MCP card, on page 9 provides details on prevention and treatment of diarrhoea. Counsel 
mother/caregiver on prevention and treatment of diarrhoea using the MCP card during your home visits.Keep children covered

You have already learnt how to prepare an ORS solution using an ORS packet 
and also home-made ORS. Use your skills to teach the mothers/caregivers both these methods of preparation of ORS during your home visits. As a recap, 
both these methods are explained below. 
1. Preparation of ors solution

1. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
2. Pour all the ORS powder from a packet into a clean container.
3. Measure one litre of clean drinking water and pour it into the container in 
which you poured ORS. (If you have ORS packets for 1/2 liter of water then take 1/2 liter water.)
4. Stir until all the powder in the container has been mixed with water and none remain at the bottom of the container.
5. Taste ORS solution before giving it to the child. It should taste like tears - neither too sweet nor to salty. If it tastes too sweet or too salty then throw away the solution and prepare ORS solution again.
6.
 Any ORS solution which is left over after 24 hours should be thrown away.

B. home-made ors solution 
Teach the mother how to make home-made ORS. 
1. Wash hands properly using soap and 
water. 
2. To prepare one glass of ORS, take 1 
glass (200 ml) of clean water, add a pinch of salt and one teaspoon of sugar. 
(See in the diagram given how a pinch 
of salt is taken with three fingers and how a teaspoon of sugar is measured). 
3. Stir the mixture until the sugar and salt dissolve. 
4. A juice of half a lime can be squeezed in. Taste the ORS solution 
before giving it to the child. It should taste like tears - neither too 
sweet nor to salty. If it tastes too sweet or too salty then throw away the solution and prepare ORS solution again. 
5. After washing hands again with soap and water, the mother 
should administer ORS solution to the child.
6. Any ORS solution which is left over after 24 hours should be 
thrown away.
1 glass of water  
(200ml)1 tea spoon of 
sugar (5gm)1 pinch of salt+ +
remember
• Ask the mother/caregiver to give one teaspoon of the solution to 
the child. This should be repeated every 1-2 minutes (an older child who can drink it in sips should be given one sip every 1-2 minutes). 
• In case of a diarrhoeal or vomit episode during ORS administration, the child and mother/caregiver and the area should be thoroughly cleaned.
• After washing hands again with soap and water, the mother/caregiver should administer ORS more slowly than before. Breastfed babies should be continued to be given breast milk in between ORS.

proper functioning of the immune system. 
• Body loses zinc during diarrhoea and it needs to be replenished.
• ORS and zinc have proven to be successful in the prevention and 
management of diarrhoea and dehydration. 
• zinc is only given to children 2 months up to 5 years for 14 days.
• The mother/caregiver will need to be taught (explained below) 
the right way to administer zinc tablets at home for a child suffering from diarrhoea (with no dehydration).
teaching mother/caregiver regarding administration of zinc tablets at home for a child 
suffering from diarrhoea (with no dehydration) 
One zinc tablet in the blister pack contains 20 mg of zinc (zinc tablets will be provided to the ASHAs).
1.  If zinc is to be administered to children 2 – 6 months age  
 a.  Half- tablet (i.e. 10 mg). is to be given. Discard the remaining half tablet.

6.1 imP ort AnCe oF F oCUssinG on e Arl Y Childhood 
DEVELOPMENT (ECD)
The first two years of life play an important role in early 
childhood development as much of what children learn, they learn in these early years of life. Children as they grow older 
learn to talk, walk, run, think and solve problems thus becoming 
more capable. These changes indicate the child’s development. Both girl and boy child require same attention and care from the families to grow and develop properly.
Proper growth and brain development during the early 
childhood period is closely related to the enabling environment 
and encouragement of young children provided by parents/
caregivers through-
 
• Playing
• Communicating-talking and smiling
• Responding appropriately to what the child communicates- 
for example, hunger, pain and discomfort, interest in 
something, or affection
Active participation of all family members/caregivers besides the mother 
like father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, other family members is important for growth and development of the child and also builds a strong, healthy 
relationship between family members/caregivers and the child. Involvement 
of family members also provides support to the mother to take adequate rest and provides her time to engage in other activities.
ASHA can play an important role in encouraging and explaining the family 
members the importance of Early Childhood Development and role of their appropriate communication with the child in ensuring the child’s proper 
growth and development.
6.2 trACKinG deVeloPment Al milestones 
Developmental milestones are activities that most children can do by a certain age. It is important for 
you to learn about the age-specific activities of children and also what parenting tips you can offer to 
the family members to help the child achieve these milestones.
You must remember-
•	That each child is unique.
•	Not all children develop at the same rate.
•	Timings of development milestone could vary from child to child. 
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,64,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child64
Some children show an interest or skills in an activity earlier than others or later than others. 
Some children develop very early, such as learning how to walk or talk much earlier than other children of the same age.
•	Low weight babies, malnourished children, sick children, children discharged from SNCU/NBSU/NRC etc. need extra stimulation with play and communication activities, to grow and develop well. Families of such children should be constantly encouraged and motivated to play and communicate with their 
children.
 
•	If the child seems ‘slow’ or ‘unable to respond’, families must 
be encouraged to provide extra care-play and communicate with the child through touch and movement.
6.3 WhA t Are deVeloPment Al delAY s? 
Child development is the period of growth (physical, mental and social) that 
begins at birth and continues through early adulthood.
• Developmental delay is a term used when a child’s development is 
delayed in one or more areas compared to other children.
• Parents and others become aware of delay when the child does not 
achieve some or all of the milestones at the expected age.
• Other children may present with behaviour problems, which may be associated with delayed development.
6.4 Undert AKinG milestone A ssessment

dUrinG the home Visits  
One of your roles under HBYC is to help the parents/caregivers in providing support for early 
childhood development during your home visits for young children (3 months up to 15 months).
The MCP card (page 12-25) provides details of milestones of children from 2-3 months of age up to 
3 years of age, which is divided in three sections. These are what most babies do, parenting tips for children and “warning” signs.
You will undertake the following activities during the household visits to support the early 
childhood development-
a. Help the mother/caregivers understand what most babies do at a specific age-This is 
done by using the MCP card section on ‘What most babies do’ (page 12-21), to track progress on development milestones of the child. There are certain milestones that have been given for 2-3 
months to 15-18 months of age children.
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,65,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child65
b. teach the mothers/caregivers to undertake milestone assessment-   You will need to teach 
mothers and caregivers the right method to observe and elicit information for various milestones 
at a particular age. This is explained in detail in the Learning Tool for 
Milestone Assessment (LTMA) that is included as Annexure-4 in the 
handbook. You will use this tool to teach the mother and caregivers to conduct an assessment for the milestones achieved by the child at a particular age. The tool provides details of normal milestones/ expected activities that are undertaken by the child at a particular age, what are the ways to observe these milestones and warning signs that require 
referral. You will need to teach the mother/caregiver, age-specific 
milestone assessments prior to your scheduled HBYC visit for the particular age group. For example- To assess the milestone assessment by mother/caregiver at 3 months, you will have to teach them the assessment during your 42nd day of HBNC visit or any other in-between contact with the family. 
Likewise, for assessment at 6 months, you will need to inform mother/caregiver about milestone 
assessment for this age-group during your 3rd month household visit. Such a pattern will be required for subsequent age groups till 15 months of age of the child. 
c. demonstrate the use of local toys/items to elicit information on 
milestones- The LTMA mentions using a set of commonly available 
items for teaching the mothers/caregivers conduct age-specific 
milestone assessment for the child. These items are easily available, 
locally in your village/slum area and can be collected while planning your HBYC visits to demonstrate use of these items to the mothers and caregivers. The items required for ECD screening is given in Annexure-3.
d. inform mothers/caregivers to record observations in the mCP Card- Once the mothers/
caregivers have learnt to conduct the age specific milestone assessment for their child, you 
will inform them to record their observations for each activity in the child’s MCP card on the first day that their child performs these activities. For the child who is able to perform the age specific activity, the parents/caregivers will need to a provide a tick mark (√) against the specific activity in the MCP card. For any activity that the child is unable to perform the parents/ 
caregivers will leave the box blank ( 
 ) in the MCP card for the activity concerned. You will 
explain the mothers/caregivers that they should not worry or panic even if the child is unable 
to perform some of these activities at the specific age mentioned in the MCP card because each 
child is unique and not all children develop at the same rate. Timings of development milestone 
could vary from child to child. Some children show an interest or skills in an activity earlier 
than others or later than others. Some children develop very early, such as learning how to 
walk or talk much earlier than other children of the same age. Thus, at any circumstance a mother/caregiver is not  expected to a put a cross mark ( X ) in the blank box ( 
 ) provided in 
the MCP card against these activities.
 Do not forget to inform the mother/caregiver that the MCP card will serve as a photo-album for their child. They should preserve it because it is the health record for the child and she/he will find it interesting and will be happy to see her/his developmental journey later in life. 
"
Handbook For ASHA On Home Based Care For Young Child-English,66,"HANDBOOK FOR ASHA ON HOME BASED CARE FOR YOUNG CHILD
Additional Home Visits to Address the Young Child66
e. Verify the milestone assessment records undertaken by mothers/caregivers- You or 
the AWW during the home visits, will verify the milestones by examining the child for all the activities as listed for a particular age of the child. In the MCP card, in ‘what most babies do’ 
section, there is a row where you will record your findings after confirming the activities 
being undertaken by the child. After making the observations, you will provide a tick mark (√) in the box if all the activity milestones for that particular age are being conducted by the child and mark cross (X) on the card, even if one activity is not achieved by the child at that particular age. The (X) sign should be put only after you have assessed and ensured that child had cooperated well, is otherwise active but is still unable to perform the  
particular activity.
 After making the observations for a particular age group, before leaving the household, do not forget to teach the mother/caregiver, the methods to observe and elicit information for milestone assessments for the subsequent age group.
f. While verifying the records if the box provided for the mother/caregiver is left blank- You must confirm whether the mother/caregiver has not marked a tick (√) because she/he has 
missed recording the particular activity or the child is unable to perform this activity. If any 
activity for milestone assessment has not been assessed by the mother/caregiver, explain them again the importance of conducting these activities with the child. You should then conduct the assessment for the child and provide a tick mark (√) against that activity if the child is able to 
do the activity concerned. If not, a cross sign (X) will be included in the box and in your next 
visit you will follow- up for achievement of that particular milestone which the child was unable to perform. 
g. look for “warning” signs as provided in the mCP card for each age group of the child and refer the child to Anm (mPW) or AWW or healthcare provider immediately in case you notice 
even a single ‘warning’ sign.
 ¾sensitise the parents/caregivers about the “warning” 
signs- This is given in the MCP card (page 12-21) and also in 
the learning tool for milestone assessment. On completion of a particular age, inform the families to contact ANM (MPW)/
AWW/health care provider or yourself immediately if the family members see any of “warning” sign for a particular age, for providing support and appropriate treatment at the healthcare facility.
h. Provide parenting tips to support early childhood development in children- As mentioned above, the parenting 
tips to the family as given in the MCP card (page 12-21), provides information on how to achieve the age-specific milestones. As you are going to help the parent/caregiver to play and communicate with the child appropriately for the age you need to provide the following counselling tips to the parent/caregiver to support child’s development-

 ¾ if the parents/caregivers do not play with the child, discuss ways to help child see, hear, 
feel and move, appropriate for child’s age and ask caregiver to do play or communication 
activity, appropriate for age. Encourage the family 
members to use non-sharp household objects that 
are clean and safe for the child for playing, if the household does not have toys for the child to play.
 ¾if the parent/caregiver does not talk to child or talks harshly to child and child is less than 6 months, ask caregiver to look into child’s eye and talk to the 
child. For older children, give caregiver and child an 
activity to do together. Help caregiver understand what child is doing and thinking and see if child responds and smiles. Help the caregiver in understanding that talking before the child talks prepares the child for talking, as children copy speech and actions of others around them.
 ¾if the parent/caregiver tries to force smile or is not responsive to child, ask caregiver make gestures and cooing sounds; copy child’s sounds and gestures and see child’s responses. Inform them about ways to make the child smile- e.g. make a funny face, gently rub the child’s 
tummy, clap their hands, play games with the child, etc.
 ¾if the parent/caregiver shows anger at the child, help caregiver distract child from unwanted 
actions by giving alternative toy or activity.
 ¾if the parent/caregiver is not able to comfort child and child does not look at the caregiver for comfort, help caregiver look into child’s eye and gently talk to child and hold child.
 ¾if the parent/caregiver says the child is slow to learn, encourage more activity with the child, check hearing and seeing. Refer child with difficulties to the nearest health centre.
Children learn by playing, trying things out and by observing and copying the actions what 
others do.
6.5 CoUnsel on Child sAFetY me AsUres
Children need a clean, safe and protected physical environment safe from injuries and accidents while 
they are playing and learning. Thus, it is also important to inform the parents/caregivers during the 
HBNC visits, on how to protect children from injuries and accidents. Advise parents to-
 ¾Keep playing objects of a child clean and washed.
 ¾Keep the child in clean surroundings by placing the child on a clean mat or clean carpet (dari) 
or clean cloth while playing.
 ¾Keep dangerous substances like medicines, poisons, insecticides, bleach, acids and liquid fertilizers and fuels (kerosene) out of children’s reach. Store carefully in clearly marked containers. 
 ¾Keep children away from fires, cooking stoves, hot liquids and foods, and exposed electric wires to prevent burn injury.

 ¾Never leave young children alone in or near water as they can drown in a very small amount of 
water, even in a tub/bucket. 
 ¾Do not let young children play on or near the road; always have someone older supervise them.
 ¾Secure stairs, roofs and windows using barriers in order to protect children from falling. 
 ¾Keep sharp and thin objects like knives, scissors, needles, etc. out of reach of children.
 ¾Keep small objects, such as coins, nuts and buttons, etc. out of reach as young children like to put them in their mouth. This can lead to choking. 
You will teach the mother/caregiver to undertake milestone assessment, check for 
developmental delays and provide appropriate counselling on parenting the child as provided 
in the MCP card during each home visit. "

7.1 EFFECT OF W ATER, S ANIT ATION AND HYGIENE (WASH) ON THE 
heAl th oF Y oUnG Child
Clean water supply, adequate sanitation (safe disposal of human urine, faeces, garbage collection and 
waste water disposal) and maintaining personal and environmental hygiene are all known to have a significant beneficial impact on health, both in households and across communities. Poor hygiene, 
inadequate quantities and quality of drinking water and lack of sanitation facilities results in deaths 
from preventable diseases. Women and children are the main victims. Various water-borne diseases can occur due to contaminated water such as food poisoning (vomiting and abdominal pain), typhoid, cholera, worm infestation, dysentery, diarrhoea, etc. 
In India, the number of deaths in children particularly due 
to diarrhoea is very high. Diarrhoeal infection is majorly 
transmitted through the faecal-oral route. The adjacent 
‘F-diagram’ illustrates the different routes that the microbes of diarrhoea take from faeces, through the environment to a new person. For example- microbes in faeces on the ground 
by a well can get into the water system and be drunk by a 
child, hands that have not been washed after going to the toilet can carry microbes onto foods, which are then eaten, infecting another child, who gets diarrhoea and spreads more 
microbes.
To accelerate the efforts to achieve universal sanitation coverage and to put focus on sanitation, the 
Government of India launched the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) on 2nd October, 2014.
7.2 PromotinG W Ater, sAnit Ation And hYGiene PrACtiCes 
dUrinG hoUsehold Visits 
Hand-washing is one of the most effective way for reducing water- borne diseases, infections like common cold, flu, pneumonia, etc. Germs can get onto hands through various ways- after people use the toilet, touch any object that has germs on it because someone coughed or sneezed on 
it or was touched by some other infected object. When these germs get onto hands and are not 
washed off, they can be passed from person to person and make other people especially children particularly sick.
You must make sure your hands are washed properly with soap before touching the child. Proper 
hand-washing means washing your hands for at least 30 seconds with soap and water to remove germs and dirt from the hands. 
You have been taught the steps of hand-washing in ASHA Module-6. The steps involved in hand-
washing are given in the figure below.

following safe WASH practices, inform them on the ways to achieve them and increase community demand for improved water supply, sanitation facilities and maintaining hygiene. Special emphasis 
needs to be given to households that have girl child, live in remote 
areas, vulnerable/marginalized populations, flood prone districts/areas, etc.
3. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), you may be the ‘Sanitation Messengers’ or ‘Swachhata Doots’ for attaining sanitation in your community and motivate households (particularly having young children), who do not have toilets for construction of toilets. This will result in the household 
moving away from open defaecation, thus limiting the spread of water-borne diseases. 
4.  For creating demand and achieving safe WASH practices in the community and particularly for 
households having young children, you may work closely with platforms like VHSNC/MAS, gram panchayat members, self-help groups, urban local bodies, religious organizations, AWWs, ANMs/
MPW, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), representatives from department of drinking 
water and sanitation, municipal corporations, community members, etc. to construct toilets at household and community level, safe disposal of faeces, improving water supply and sanitation facilities in the community, ensuring availability of dustbins and timely collection of waste disposal to control the spread of diseases. 
5.  Be involved in disseminating information to the community members regarding the ‘VISHWAS’ 
(Village based Initiative to Synergise Health, Water and Sanitation) campaign for improving 
water, sanitation and hygiene situation and its impact on health and quality of life at the community level. You along with the ANM/MPW and AWW will communicate the date, time and venue of campaign day to village community, all VHSNC members, and the teachers and students of school and children in anganwadi, preferably about seven days before the campaign day and 
arrange information, education and communication materials required to conduct such large 
village level campaign. This will encourage community participation and help disseminate information to the community regarding the importance of safe WASH practices. 
You must practice the steps of hand-washing during each visit. Also, ensure that families are 
counselled on hand- washing and hand-washing is practised by them to prevent the spread 
of illness within the household."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,4,"Acknowledgements
The Induction Training Module for ASHAs in urban areas is derived largely from 
the Induction Training Module of rural ASHAs. It represents the hard work of a 
large number of individuals and institutions who were involved in developing 
these modules. Acknowledgements are due to members of the Technical Advisory Group for community processes under NUHM, National ASHA 
Mentoring Group and State Nodal Officers for ASHA and Community Processes, 
who provided valuable insights and feedback for developing this Module. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,5,"What is this Book about?
You have chosen to be an ASHA. You have been selected by your community 
to serve as a resource because you understand their needs, their beliefs and 
practices, the social factors, where the poor and needy live, and what people 
want from health services. You already know a lot about the community in which you live. However in order to be an effective resource, you need 
additional knowledge and skills. You need to learn about health rights and 
entitlements, the causes and treatment of common illnesses, and type of treatment available at different facilities. You need to develop the skills to 
communicate health related information to people in the community, to 
counsel them on prevention of illness and to adopt healthy behaviours, to treat minor ailments and the leadership ability to help people negotiate access to 
rights and entitlements. 
This book is the first in a series of books that will help you do this. As a new 
entrant to the ASHA programme, this book provides you with a basic level of 
knowledge and skills to enable you to start your work. After you have grasped 
the contents of this book and have applied your new knowledge in your community, additional rounds of trainings will follow, in which you will not only 
learn many new things but also get more information on topics that you will 
learn in this book. Your community is also an important source of knowledge. Use the knowledge and skills that you get from your books, to build on your 
learning from the community, so that you can offer help to the people. That 
is why your training is conducted for a short duration and allows you time to practice your new skills in the community. After this training, you will be 
assessed and get a basic certification in communication and social mobilisation. 
The next level of certification is after four rounds of training and this will enable you to address issues in care of mothers, newborns and children. As your skill 
level improves, additional certification will be available. "

What are the Main Roles of the ASHA? 
An ASHA is “ a woman selected by her community, based in her community 
and serves as a resource to her community” . Your role is three-fold: to be 
a facilitator of health services and link people to health care facilities, to 
be a provider of community level health care, and an activist, who builds people’s understanding of health rights and enables them to access their entitlements. Being an ASHASection 1
Didi, which day is the ANM 
coming to our area?
Didi, they are charging me at the 
govt hospital and I don’t have the 
money to pay – can you help me?This is the first day of diarrhoea. Do I 
have go to the big hospital or is there 
something you can suggest?
With continuous training and support, you mature in your role as an ASHA. You gain the confidence of the people, make them aware of their health rights and 
gradually start to involve and mobilise the community in local health planning."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,8,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas
8Activities of an ASHA 
ASHA’s work consists mainly of five activities:
1. Home visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or five days 
a week, you should visit the families living in your community. If it is a large 
area, then you will have a certain number of allocated households. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, 
families will come to you when there is a problem and you will not have to 
go so often to their houses. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, you should visit 
the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the 
house, a series of seven visits or more becomes essential.
2. Attending the Urban Health and Nutrition Day (UHND): On one day 
every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide 
antenatal care, immunisation and other services in the area, you, as the ASHA will promote attendance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM 
services and help with service delivery.
3. Visits to the health facility: This is usually accompanying a pregnant woman 
sick child or some other neighbour who requests her services for escort.  
The visit could also be to attend a training programme or review meeting. In some months, there would be only one visit, in others, there would be more.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,11,"11
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasValues of an ASHA
Here are some important values which should guide you in your work: 
Be kind:  Have compassion for people and never be afraid to show that you 
care.  Be especially kind to those who are sick, it is more important than a 
medicine. Try not to refuse your services to any individual who really needs 
them. 
Treat everybody equally:  Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or 
his class, caste, sex and religion. As a health worker your concern is well being 
of all the individuals not just those you know well or who come to you or 
who are the better off and powerful. Inequalities in our society deprive many 
sections of community from health care services. These are the marginalised people and include those who come from extremely poor families, live in 
inaccessible or distant part of our community, belong to scheduled caste/
scheduled tribe families, have only women in their households and are disabled or handicapped. Treating everybody equally also means spending more time 
and effort on those whose needs are more.
Be responsible: Be responsible to your designated duties and never misuse 
your authority for your benefit or for the benefit of friends and relatives 
Respect people’s traditions and ideas:  People are slow to change their 
attitudes and traditions and are true to what they feel is right. Rather than 
insisting that they adopt your approach, you must try to build on their existing 
knowledge with your ideas. For example-you can promote the use of modern 
medicine together with the traditional methods and the combination may serve better than either one alone. Thus, you can promote the use of ORS for 
treating a child with diarrhoea but at the same time encourage mothers to use 
traditional preparation like rice water, coconut water to overcome dehydration.
Keep learning: Use every chance you get to increase your own knowledge 
either through reading books, or attending training programmes or asking 
questions. 
Be a role model:  If you want people to take part in improving their area and 
care for their health, you must be a role model and practise healthy habits and 
behaviours. This way you will earn people’s trust and confidence. "

12ASHA Support and Supervision
For you to be effective and to continuously improve your skills, you  
need support and mentoring while you work in the community and  
also refresher trainings. 
ASHA Support  
mainly comes from
Auxillary Nurse Midwife  
Anganwadi Worker and Mahila 
Aarogya Samiti Members
ASHA Facilitators
You all are expected to work together as a local health team 
Anganwadi worker
The Anganwadi worker, like you is also a local resident. She is in charge of the 
Anganwadi Centre, which provides these services: 
l Supplementary nutrition: For children below six years, and for pregnant 
and lactating Mothers. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take-
home rations. Malnourished children are given additional food supplements. 
Adolescent girls (10 years to 19 years) are also given Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplement and tablets for de-worming."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,13,"13
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Growth monitoring: Involves weighing of all children below 5 years of age, 
but especially those who are under 3 years of age, growth monitoring through 
growth charts, tracking malnourished children and referral for children who are 
severely malnourished. 
l Pre-school non-formal education: Includes activities for playful learning and providing a stimulating environment, with inputs for growth and 
development especially for children between three to six years of age.
Mahila Aarogya Samiti (MAS)
Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) as the name suggest are local women’s collective. 
They are expected to take collective action on issues related to Health, 
nutrition, Water Sanitation and its social determinants at Slum/Ward level. 
They were particularly envisaged as being central to ‘local community action’ , which would gradually develop to the process of decentralized 
health planning. Thus MASs are expected to act as a leadership platforms 
for woman’s and focal community group in each slum area for improving awareness and access of community for health services, support the ASHA/
Front line health worker/ANM, to develop health plans specific to the local 
needs and serves as a mechanism to promote community action for health. 
Main purpose of Mahila Arogya Samiti (MAS) includes, demand generation, 
ensuring optimal utilization of services, establishing referral linkages, 
increasing community ownership and sustainability and establishing a community based monitoring system.
The MAS is to be formed at Slum level, will approximately covers approximately 
50-100 households. It should have 10 -12 members, depending on the size of the slum with representation should be ensured from all groups and from all 
pockets of the slum. Every MAS should have a bank account opened in the 
nearest bank, to which the untied fund of Rs 5000 per year to each MAS shall be credited. The chairperson & Member secretary (ASHA) are the joint signatories 
of MAS account. It can use these funds for any purpose aimed at improving 
health of the community. It is to be utilized as per decision of the MAS. Nutrition, education, sanitation, environmental protection, public health measures, 
emergency transport are the key areas where this fund could be utilized.

ASHA Facilitator
The first level of support for you is the 
ASHA facilitator. In most states there is 
full time woman employee for this role. 
In a few states the ANM plays the role of an ASHA facilitator. There is one facilitator 
for every 10 to 20 ASHAs. She will meet 
with you at least twice a month. One of these interactions will be in the form of 
a “mentoring” visit to the households 
where you provide services. You will also meet your facilitator in the monthly 
review meeting or a cluster meeting 
(with other ASHAs from neighbouring areas). 
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife 
The ANM provides services at the first level of the health system, which is the urban primary health centre. But her main interaction with you is through the 
Urban Health and Nutrition Day. You will learn about the urban primary health 
centre later in this module. Tasks of the ASHA Facilitators 
1. Support to ASHA to promote healthy behaviours and improve service access among families who find it difficult to change behaviours, 
through household visits.
2. Provides on the job training to the ASHA by observing and helping her 
during counselling or care.
3. Helps ASHAs plan her work.
4. Builds up mutual solidarity and motivation among ASHA in a cluster.
5. Collects health related information on the ASHA’s work.
6. Troubleshoots problems, especially as regards payments and addressing grievances. 
7. Refills ASHA drug kit"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,16,"Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas
16Urban Health and Nutrition Day 
(UHND)
It is a common platform for people to access 
services of the ANM, Male health worker and 
of the Anganwadi Worker (AWW). It is held 
at the Anganwadi Centre (AWC) once every month. The ANM gives immunisation to the 
children, provides antenatal care to pregnant 
women and provides counselling and contraceptive services to eligible couples. 
In addition, the ANM provides a basic level 
of curative care for minor illness with referral where needed. The UHND is 
an occasion for health communication on a number of key health issues. It 
should be attended by the members of ward committee or MAS, particularly 
the women members, pregnant women, women with children under two, adolescent girls and general community members. 
It is important for you to know that UHND is a major mobilisation event for your 
community and a good opportunity to reinforce health messages. As you gain experience and learn from different training programmes, you should use this 
forum to provide information on the topics in Annexure (1). These topics can 
be taken up one by one and completed over a period of one year. 
What should you do for a successful UHND?
After finishing this round of training, you can go back and make a list of the 
following and ensure their presence during the upcoming UHND
l Pregnant women for their antenatal care and mothers needing  postnatal care. 
l Infants who need their next dose of immunisation.
l Malnourished children.
l TB patients who are on anti-TB drugs.
l Those with fever who have not been able to see a doctor. 
l Eligible couples who need contraceptive services or counselling.
l Any others who want to meet the ANM.
Remember: As you prepare the list of people requiring services at UHND, 
make special effort to include individuals from families of new migrants & 
homeless, those living in distant areas, vulnerable persons because of poverty or otherwise marginalised. Coordinate with the AWW and the ANM to know 
in advance which day the UHND is scheduled so as to inform those who need 
these services and the community, especially the MAS members. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,17,"17
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasClarifying roles and responsibilities: Given that you, the AWW, and the ANM 
work as a team, it is important that you understand not just your role, but their 
as well. The chart given in section 4 will help you understand your work with 
respect to ANM and AWW. 
Working arrangements 
As a volunteer you have a flexible work schedule. Your workload is limited to putting in about three to five hours per day on about four days per week, 
except during some mobilisation events and training programmes. Your tasks 
are to be so tailored that it does not interfere with your normal livelihood, and fits into the ‘five activities’ described on page: 8.
You will receive monetary incentive for some of the tasks you perform but there 
are many tasks which are essential for the good of the community that you would need to undertake voluntarily. For tasks where you have to be away for 
most of the day, you would be compensated. For example - training days and 
for participating in monthly meetings. 
(An illustrative list of activities for which you are paid incentives will be 
informed to you at U-PHC.

l Lack of access to health services
l Lack of health education
Malnutrition is the main cause of ill health
l Malnourished people fall ill very easily because they have reduced capacity 
to keep themselves free from diseases. That’s why they fall ill very easily and 
stay ill for a long time. 
l Diseases like diarrhoea, measles, malaria and pneumonia are often the cause 
for death of malnourished people.
l Around 50% of our population is very poor and they have to deal with a lot of difficult circumstances in their lives.
l Girls and women are often seen to be more malnourished 
Unsafe water and lack of sanitation
l Unsafe water is cause of many diseases. 
l The lack of sanitation leads to contaminated and unsafe drinking water
l In both villages and cities, the non-availability of safe drinking water facilities for all residents also leads to more diseases

Hunger is the main cause of malnutrition (lack of awareness is relatively a smaller problem)
Poverty is the reason for hunger (availability of food is not the problem, the problem is that 
the poor do not have money to buy enough food)
Malnutrition causes illness again and again
Falling ill repeatedly leads to malnutrition
Expenses on treatment further leads to poverty and more malnutrition
Leading to more disease…more malnutrition
This continuous process leads to ill health
Unhealthy living conditionsCrowded living spaces, damp rooms, smoke and dust filled environment,  
all these give rise to respiratory problems and lead to diseases like TB.
Unhealthy habits like alcohol and drug abuse
Unhealthy habits related to life style like alcoholism and use of other intoxicants, 
drugs and norcotic substances are also a major cause of bad health in many 
families. They also lead to social problems at the family  and community level.
Hard labour and difficult work conditions
l Having to do hard labour e.g. pulling cycle-rickshaws
l Working for long hours
l Conditions of work increase the possibilities for disease and illness. 
For example: working unprotected in stone quarries leads to severe 
respiratory problems, spraying pesticides without protection
l Unsafe equipment and work tools
Patriarchy (unequal power relation between mam and woman resulting in gender discrimination)
When we compare men and women, we find that more women fall ill than men. The core reason for this is patriarchy. It means that our society is 
dominated by men and accords a lower status to women. This causes  
ill-health for women in the following ways:
l In the family, women eat last and also get lesser quantities of food to eat
l Women have to bear the burden of work both in the home and outside
l Women have lesser access to health services"

l Women are taught to feel ashamed about their bodies

l Women are made to give the least importance to their health
l They are subjected to violence, abuse and harassment
l They also face the constant fear that men can leave them or kick them out 
of the house 
l Females are subjected to female feticide, girl infanticide, and dowry death
Mental tension
l Many times the negative circumstances of life become too much to bear and leads to mental stress
l Breakdown of society or family, unemployment, social insecurity, no relaxation, these all are causes of mental tension
l People fall ill due to mental tension. Sometimes this also leads to the extreme step of committing suicide.
Lack of access to health servicesThe government is responsible for providing healthcare services to all people. However, many a time people are not able to access these services. This may be 
due to many reasons, for example:
l Health facilities like U-PHC are non- functional due to lack of availability/
vacant positions of ANMs, doctors, nurses and other staff. 
l Overburdening of health facility staff may also limits their effectiveness in providing care to the patients. 
l Provision of care is also adversely affected in cases where the staff of health facility lacks initiative or is negligent.
l People are unable to avail adequate health services due to limited availability of diagnostics and medicines in health centres in some places.
l Block and district hospitals sometimes also lack adequate services 
l Lack of connectivity, unavailability of transport, geographic barriers limits the reach of the people to avail health services. 
l In many places, people have to spend some money from their own pockets even if they go to Government hospitals. The cost of going to private 
hospitals is even higher. Therefore many poor people are not able to take 
treatment from proper hospitals.

l The lack of participation by the community in health and the lack of relationship between the community and health staff result in 
such problems."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasAn “Activist” is person who actively leads her/his community for a 
particular cause. Before we discuss your role in detail, you should read the 
real life examples of activism in Annexure 3.
As an ASHA you are expected to play the role of an activist primarily 
to reduce inequities and improve the access of marginalised and 
disadvantaged to public health care services. To do this you should work 
“along” with them and not “for” them, and make them understand 
their health needs, rights and subsequently avail services. Mobilising 
the community takes time and is energy consuming. As you mature in 
your work, with continuous training and support, you will gradually learn to mobilise your community for accessing their health rights. In the 
meanwhile, try not to lose patience and hope.
“In the broadest sense, a community activist is one who works for 
social change in the community.” 
Understanding Fundamental Rights
You will often find that people are not aware of their rights and face prejudices. Thus, knowledge about fundamental rights is important for every individual 
including you, the ASHA. It will help you to take appropriate decisions for the 
development of your community. 
The six Fundamental Rights granted by our Constitution are: 
The Right to Equality – This right ensures that same laws are applicable to 
every citizen. No citizen can be  discriminated against on the basis of religion, 
caste, sex, race or place of birth. He/she is entitled to have access to public 
places like shops, eating places, public health facilities, wells, tanks, bathing 
ghats, roads, playgrounds and places dedicated for the use of general public. 
Understanding Rights and 
Right to HealthSection 3
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,24,"24
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRight to Freedom: The Right to Freedom enables us to speak and express freely, 
assemble peacefully without arms, form associations or unions, move freely 
throughout the territory of India, to live and settle in any part of India, practice 
any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. 
Right Against Exploitation: This right grants clear provisions to prevent 
exploitation of weaker/vulnerable sections of the community and prohibits 
“traffic i.e. selling or buying of human beings, (usually women for immoral purpose). Forced labour, bonded labour or captivity of any human being as slave 
is completely barred and employment of a child below the age of fourteen to 
work in any factory or mine or any other hazardous work is not allowed. 
Right to Freedom of Religion: This right allows every person a right to practice the religion he or she believes. 
Cultural and Educational Rights of minorities: Any citizen with a distinct language or culture has a right to practice this. No citizen can be denied 
admission to any educational institution maintained by government on the 
grounds of religion or language. All minorities have a right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice
Right to Constitutional Remedies: This right empowers citizens to approach 
the court in cases of denial of any of the Fundamental Rights. Under this 
right, it is the duty of the Judiciary to attend to all complaints pertaining to 
violation or rights. 
Understanding the Meaning of Right to Health
Your understanding of the Right to Health will help you to be vigilant and take action to enable community’s access to avail health care services from the 
Public Health System. 
Right to Health means 
l People should have convenient access to a public healthcare facility which 
is functional and implements comprehensive health programmes with 
adequate providers, drugs and equipment.
l  Health facilities and services must be of good quality and available to 
everyone without any discrimination. Nobody should be refused treatment 
on the basis of religion, caste, economic status, gender, sexual orientation 
and place of residence etc. 
l Health services should be affordable for all. 
l Community should have information about the available services irrespective of their caste/class/religion/sex and where they live. They 
should be aware about their entitlements from the Public Health System. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,25,"25
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasY our community’s rights to health are protected if:
l Your community is able to avail free health services in the area on 
specific days through public health systems and have access to all kind of 
preventive and curative services in public health centres and hospitals with 
referral to higher facility when required.
l The community is aware about the health services and entitlements they can avail from the public health system such as free services in public 
sector hospitals, schemes of Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) or Janani 
Sishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) and any other health schemes being implemented by the government. (These two are described in the section 
on Maternal health) 
l All sections of the community including the marginalised are able to 
access the health services and avail entitlements and ANMs visit their areas 
regularly provide free services to all. 
l Grievance Redressal: There is a space for public dialogue and where people 
can lodge complaints and obtain redressal.
As an ASHA, you are an important link between the community and the Health Facility and you also help in creating an empowered community that is aware about its health rights and entitlement and is able to demand it. 
Understanding National Urban Health Mission (NUHM)
The National Urban Health Mission was launched in 2012-13 and it places high focus on reaching urban primary health services to the most vulnerable 
amongst the poor. Under the NUHM special emphasis is given on improving the 
reach of health care services to these vulnerable groups among the urban poor, falling in the category of beggars, street children, construction workers, coolies, 
rickshaw pullers, sex workers, street vendors and other such migrant workers. 
The NUHM is based on a rights framework and the ASHA is the first point through which people can be mobilized to realize their rights. 
Now, we will learn about the public health facilities at various levels, services 
offered and the team of providers at each level. Annexure 4 contains a detailed check list, to enable you to assess the quality of health services being provided 
in these facilities. 
You should also try to map out the distances of each of these 
facilities from your area and identify the possible means of transportation for reaching these centres. This would be useful in undertaking appropriate referral 
as and when needed."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasNavigating complex public health facilities
One of the most common complaints of the people is the difficulty they face in 
accessing health care services at public hospitals/centres. Many times, they have 
to face harassment or end up paying charges for the services which are entitled 
free to them. The reasons could be lack of awareness of the entitlements and free services; unfamiliarity with the hospital and services available at the 
hospital; overcrowding etc. which discourage them to avail services from the 
public hospitals. 
As an ASHA, you will soon become familiar to the health centres and hospitals 
in your area. This information would help you to facilitate easy access to health 
services for the patients from your community. Your role would be:
l Easy and fast registration at the hospital
l Guiding the patients to the right doctor/counter/department as per the patient requirement
l Informing them about the free services and entitlements like referral transport, free diagnostics, free medications, blood transfusion etc.
l Preventing any kind or harassment of the patients and their relatives by the touts or the staff asking for ‘under the table’ charges.District

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasPreserving Women’s Right to Health
“The status of women in society can be used to measure the culture 
and actual development of any country”
Even today many women in our country are unable to exercise basic rights.  It 
is important to realise that unlike most men, women have to work hard both 
at home and outside. Thus women spend considerable time and effort in 
managing the house as well as helping in the income generating activity of the house-hold , so they end up with twice as much work. It is essential for you 
to understand the health status of women in our community, the common problems they face and your role in addressing some of these challenges. Women suffer many problems in various stages of their life.
In addition to these problems, caused by social and cultural beliefs, women are 
also more vulnerable to certain conditions/illnesses because of their physiology or body structure and functions. For instance, Women’s reproductive systems 
are more vulnerable, so they get more infections than men including sexually transmitted infections.
Women also bear the burden and pain of childbirth and abortions and are often 
solely responsible for family planning. Women have to take approval of the in-
laws or the husband even for a health check- up. They often have no money to pay for health care on their own. Our health services and providers are also not 
fully sensitive to women’s health care needs.
Women are also generally blamed for not giving birth to baby boy, which is 
wrong. "

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasASHA’s role in addressing these issues
As an ASHA you are expected to help women in improving their health and 
social status. You should motivate women and convince the community 
to enhance the integrity of women in the community. To begin with, you 
should counsel and convince the community to change unfair and gender discriminatory practices. You could make a start by:
l Increasing participation and voice of women in all community level meetings
l Motivating women to take part in making decisions in the family. 
l Encouraging Women to eat well and take enough rest.
l Encouraging girls to complete school education
l Ensuring that women’s’ health problems are given due importance and that they receive appropriate care
You could also:
l Discuss with men the need to share domestic work and child care.
l Take collective action to stop physical or mental abuse of women.
l Counsel families to raise boys and girls equally in terms of nutrition, education, and opportunities. 
l Increase awareness regarding illegality of pre-natal sex determination as well as female foeticide and infanticide.
l Raise awareness in the community about delaying age of marriage until the legal age of marriage
l Promote use of contraceptives for delay in first child birth and maintaining gap between children. 
l Increase participation of men in family planning issues.
l Provide counselling and ensure adequate care is received by women during pregnancy, child birth and post- partum period."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasLeadership
Leadership as an ASHA involves mobilising people and resources towards 
achieving the common goal of health care. Through knowledge and experience 
most people have the potential to become a leader in any given situation. As 
an ASHA you often have to play the role of a leader. Hence it is important to understand the meaning of leadership and qualities, which will help you in 
being an effective leader
Leadership means to be
l Responsible 
l Setting an example so other people follow you. 
l  Inspiring - provide optimism and confidence in people for their 
ability to carve change.
l  Non-judgemental with people and transparent in your actions 
l  Confident, assertive, enthusiastic, passionate and accountable 
l  Skilled in enabling people to cooperate for getting things done.
Leadership style 
People adopt different leadership styles. The two common styles are  
a) Authoritarian and b) Participatory
Authoritarian leaders do not welcome cooperation or collaboration from others. 
They expect people to do what they are told without question or debate. They are usually intolerant of what they do not agree with. It is difficult for team members 
to contribute their views or empower themselves under this kind of leadership. 
A participatory leader creates a positive environment in which all members 
can reach their highest potential. They encourage the community to effectively 
reach the set goals and simultaneously strengthen the bonds among various 
members. This leads to a more productive team. As an ASHA, it is most appropriate to adopt a participatory leadership style. 
Skills of an ASHASection 4"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,32,"32
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasFor participatory leadership you need to
l Establish goals and set the direction: First articulate an achievable goal 
for your area. Involve your community through local institutions especially 
the Mahila Aarogya Samiti on how, where and when it would be completed. 
For example, all children of your area should be immunised in the next six months. 
l Set high standards and high expectations: Be firm 
about ensuring high quality health care services from 
the sub-centre and the U-PHC for your community. 
Eg. Make sure that the ANM reaches the area on the designated UHND, with the requisite equipment and 
drugs (weighing scales, BP apparatus, disposable 
syringes for immunisation, ice box for vaccines) and drugs and provides the package of services for 
mothers and children. If the health service provider treats a community member with disrespect or does not provide the services or does not pay 
attention to quality, you should feel able to ask her to change behaviour or 
practice.
l Be accountable and responsible: to the community and the health care provider by being an effective link and sharing information. But being 
constantly critical of the situation will have no positive outcome. Address the 
issue by sharing your grievances with authorities who can take action. For example, if the ANM is not coming to your area regularly or she is not visiting 
the houses of socially backward families, have the courage to tell her that you 
have noted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. Enlist the help of MAS, Sarpanch, Block Medical Health Officer or Chief Medical 
Health Officer and ensure that the ANM visits your area regularly.
l Involve others in decision-making: Do not make any decisions alone. A 
decision, which affects the community, needs to be taken along with the community members, with their complete ownership. For example, better 
results are attained if priorities and decisions regarding community health needs are taken as part of collectives such as the MAS. 
l Motivate others: By involving the Panchayat, SHG members and MAS 
through regular contact, sharing necessary information, giving them 
responsibility and acknowledging their support and efforts in public. 
Invite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care. Involve community members in the process when availing for them 
their entitlements from the public health system or by giving them some 
responsibility to improve the health status of the community. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,33,"33
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Achieve unity: As a leader you need to promote unity among your 
community members and between the community members and health 
care providers. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership 
for their health and see that they also have a role in achieving the goal.
l Serve as a role models: Always set an example that can be followed. For 
example, you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman 
for a referral. If you performed this role and saved the life of woman in 
your area, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman 
during an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if 
required. You should constantly improve your knowledge and skills and try to 
be aware of any new developments regarding the health services and new 
schemes declared primarily by being in touch with the ANM. Improve your 
skills by practising them.
l Represent the community: Make sure you represent the entire community 
(including the marginalised sections) while discussing their health concerns 
with the health service provider. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive community health plan along with the Panchayat and MAS. 
While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of 
the poor of your community. If some segment of the community has shared 
that the source of drinking water is not accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion while developing a comprehensive health plan for the 
community . 
Communication Skills
Communication is the exchange or 
two-way flow of information and ideas 
between two or more persons. People 
who do not communicate well, create confusion, frustration and problems. Your 
communication skills will enable you to 
counsel women and families on health promotion, adopting healthier practices 
and mobilising them to avail services at health institutions. They also help you 
establish rapport with the stakeholders and other health functionaries.There are three different forms of communication - verbal; non-verbal and written. 
Each of these is useful for you. 
l Verbal communication: This is the most common way of communicating, 
but should be done in a way that the person or persons to whom you are 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,34,"34
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areascommunicating the message has understood it. So you must deliver it in 
a way that the person understands what you are saying. To know if your 
message was received properly, get feedback from the person whether she/
he understood the message. One-way communication is when only you talk 
and the other has not understood. This is incomplete and ineffective.
Effective Verbal Communication has Accuracy;  
Clarity and Correctness. 
l Non-Verbal Communication: We all know that communication is not only 
about words and languages. Silence also communicates, and there are 
gestures that people make with their hands, body and eyes. These forms 
of communication are referred to as non-verbal communication. Here are some non-verbal forms of communication:
l Eye contact: with the person to whom you are talking will indicate your sincerity and confidence. 
l Body posture: Facing the person, standing or sitting appropriately close and holding your head erect gives value or weight to your messages
l Facial expressions: Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions therefore express appropriate feelings on your face
l Gestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value 
but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. 
l Written Communication: As an ASHA you will need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You 
also need to document the processes and decisions taken during meetings. 
You will thus have to learn to write simply and effectively. (In Annexure 5, 
there is an exercise for you on writing). Even if you take the help of others in 
the community, you should remember the following important points: 
l Address it to the appropriate person 
l Check that the letter has a date and topic 
l Keep sentences short and avoid unnecessary words
l Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones 
l Explain facts through evidence and examples 
Active listening is also part of communication
Hearing and listening are not the same. Hearing is involuntary, while listening 
involves the reception and interpretation of what is heard. Active listening 
involves listening with a purpose. It may be to gain information, obtain "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,35,"35
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasdirections, understand others, solve problems, share interests, and see how the 
other person feels, or even show support. This type of listening takes the same 
amount of, or more, energy than speaking. It requires the listener to hear various 
messages, understand the meaning and then verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. 
For good listening: Encourage individuals to talk by using positive gestures 
and words, remove distractions and try to understand non-verbal signals. Do not pass judgments or criticise mid-way while some one is speaking. Reflect 
on the feeling expressed and paraphrase what has been heard. This will enable 
establishing a good rapport with the community.
Communicating with stakeholders- Keep in mind the following points while talking to stakeholders and health functionaries- 
l Give due respect to all the stakeholders, whether they are from the community or from the health care system. 
l While sharing information with the stakeholders, make sure that you prepare with the necessary information, data and evidence.
l Never generalise the information. Be very specific about what you want or do not want from them, what you want to change and what you 
want to continue.
l Be calm while communicating. Do not show your anxiety and do not 
use a blaming tone.
You will be surprised by how a simple smile and humility will affect those 
around you. And, of course, confidence and assertiveness will help get your 
message through.
Points to take care of while communicating:
l When you visit families, greet the individuals and explain the reason of your 
visit.
l Maintain eye contact with the person to whom you are talking, act with confidence but speak in a gentle tone which is loud enough to be heard and 
always be respectful
l Stick to the point so that you do not end up using too much time and use 
simple words in local language. Do not use technical words or jargon. Your 
pronunciation should be clear.
l Be specific, sincere, honest and direct while communicating. 
l Be empathetic and try to share the feelings of individuals."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,36,"36
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Be open-minded. This will help you understand the other person’s point of 
view. In case of talking to your beneficiary check if she has any question and 
answer in simple language
l Acknowledge the efforts made by the beneficiaries and never forget to 
compliment/appreciate them.
Note: In health communication, while counselling individuals you need to actively listen to what is being said, analyse all the factors and then dialogue with the person so that, together, the right choices are made. Counselling involves problem 
solving and not merely preaching to adopt correct practices. 
Decision Making Skills
Each decision has a consequence and even a small 
decision can change many things. All of us can recall 
some such decisions taken personally or by others 
which have left an important impact. As an ASHA you will be often required to take decisions, that will affect 
the community at large. Hence, you should learn the 
skill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. 
Some basic steps of decision-making are: 
l Define the Problem: Examine the situation carefully 
and analyse it from all perspectives to find out the 
actual problem. 
l Gather Information and share with the community: As a next step collect 
all the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Take information on what exists, what does not 
exists and what needs to be there. At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meeting and discuss the situation to help them 
become part of the solution. 
l Think of possible solutions: You should work with the MAS and even the 
Gram Sabha if needed on identifying solutions. At this stage many solutions will be offered. It shows that people accept and understand the problem, and 
are interested in identifying solutions.
l Choose one solution by consensus: Part of effective decision-making is 
the ability to select one alternative from the various options available. This 
can be done through consensus of the community and approval of the 
authorities. To gain consensus and approval you need to discuss this in the MAS meetings and the Gram Sabha. Before selecting the right alternative, 
assess all available options. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,37,"37
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Put the Decisions to Work: An effective decision is one which can be put 
into action. Thus, implementation is very important. During this process, 
keep checking if it is moving towards the expected solution, and if there is 
something else which needs to be addressed. An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling 
among group members after the meeting 
has been a djourned. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature 
among persons or groups.
Decision-making skills are sharpened through experience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. 
How to handle difficult situations
If you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and 
review the options. It may be a good idea to adjourn and let people think about

Negotiation Skills
Negotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. As 
an ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these 
differences to achieve the larger goals of health programmes. You will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to fulfil your 
responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to negotiate 
with people in authority but with enough preparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situation which requires negotiation. 
The steps of Successful Negotiation
l Ask for the other person’s perspective: In a negotiating situation use 
questions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. 
Some examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? 
What are your concerns about what I am suggesting/asking? When you hear 
the other person express their needs or concerns, use appropriate listening 
responses to make sure you heard correctly. 
l State Y our needs: In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but 
also why you need it. 
l Prepare options beforehand: Before entering into a negotiation, prepare 
some options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not 
acceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and 
be prepared to counter the same with an alternative. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,38,"38
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Do not argue: Negotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about 
trying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation 
when each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. 
If you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a power struggle. 
l Consider timing: There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on 
either side, a preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or 
tiredness on one side or the other. 
Suggestions for effective negotiation 
While negotiating as an ASHA you must be patient. Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to 
understand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not 
begin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. 
Approach a negotiation with an attitude of, “I accept you as an equal 
negotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ 
You may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. 
How to use your negotiation skills effectively?
In your community you may come across several issues that require to be 
addressed. For example, UHND does not take place, the Anganwadi is not 
functioning well; children and women are not receiving their entitlement of 
supplementary food; the midday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly; widow pension is not being received despite completion of 
formalities etc. 
l To change such situations first try to find out if things can be changed 
by drawing the attention of people like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the 
schoolteacher, AWW through direct dialogue.
l If the situation still does not improve, try to organise people and facilitate 
group discussions over the issue. The MAS meeting is a good forum to 
address such issues.
l If this also does not work, try to identify organisations working on the same 
issue and seek their support. If you decide to initiate a movement alongwith 
the people to change a situation, organising people who are affected with the 
same issues is important and is essential for activism to be effective. 
l Activism/Protest may not always be the best method of changing the situation but it can be quite useful under the right circumstances. It gives 
voice to a cause."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasCoordination Skills
As an ASHA you are a link between health care services and the community and 
expected to regularly coordinate with various stakeholders and the community. 
The coordination with the ASHA and AWW has already been discussed. 
To achieve the goal of healthy community, you need to work in coordination 
with different departments and stakeholders. Coordinated action between 
different departments is called as “Convergence” . These departments include:
l Health Department
l Education Department
l Urban Local Bodies
l Women and Child Develpment
l Local NGOs
You should work in coordination with the field level functionaries of these departments. 
1.  Monitor the situation of water, sanitation, nutrition, housing, education services in your area. 
2.  Arrange a monthly and quarterly meeting with all relevant stakeholders to discuss the community issues and devise a plan to address those issues. Coordinate with your ANM and supervisor to arrange a meeting with the 
above mentioned stakeholders. 
3.  Advocate with the local authorities for taking necessary actions to address 
the identified issues. For eg. Construction or repair of community toilets, 
water drains, improving sewerage, drainage and disposal system etc.ASHAUrban

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasMAS is the key body which can take the collective action on issues related 
to health, nutrition, water, sanitation and all other social determinants at 
community level. Therefore, you can work with MAS members to perform the 
above mentioned functions effectively. 
There are certain government schemes for urban development like JNNURM/BSUP/IHSDP . You should try to find out from your facilitator or 
U-PHC Medical officer about the schemes that are functional in your area. 
How to be an effective coordinator of a local meeting?
As an ASHA you have to prepare adequately before the meeting. Meet the 
participants beforehand and inform them about the agenda (can be shared 
orally) of the meeting. Have clarity on what you are going to discuss and be 
aware about the complexity of the issue.
l While having the discussion, listen and observe carefully. Any change in a person’s expression communicates a lot. Be prepared with the counter-
arguments. During the discussion, if you need to take some on-the-spot 
decision, be prepared for it and articulate th e outcome. Give time to each person to share their views and avoid simultaneous discussions 
l At the end of the discussion, briefly articulate the decision taken or actions to be taken after the meeting. List down the actions along with who is 
responsible for the action, who will support it and a time-line for completion 
of the action
l Within a few days after the discussion. Ensure that the decisions are put into action. 
l It is very important that each meeting is documented. You may use the given format to document your meetings. See Annexure 6
l In the process of coordination, each member plays an important role. As an ASHA you need to make sure that 
you are in touch with all the concerned stakeholders and 
keep them informed of the progress. 
l Never hesitate to take help of others while facilitating a meeting. If you need help, identify the person well in 
advance and brief her/him what kind of help you need. 
You should have full confidence in the person you select. "

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,42,"Vulnerability Mapping and Assessment
Who are vulnerable? 
Urban population is growing rapidly in India. We all have seen that many rural 
residents come to cities in search of employment. But due to overcrowding and 
lack of necessary infrastructure like housing, water and sanitation, employment 
opportunities and basic services like health and education, these people start living in jhuggi like houses called slums. Some of them also survive on the road, 
under flyovers, railway platforms and outside shops without shelter and in 
unsafe conditions.
It has adverse implications on their health. Poor access to safe water and basic 
sanitation (a common problem for most urban poor) also affects the physical 
and cognitive development of children, gastrointestinal disorders in adults, and makes it difficult for girls and women to maintain personal and menstrual 
hygiene. Poor housing gives little or no physical protection against the heat, 
cold, pollution, traffic, accidents, and physical and sexual abuse. 
Children, adolescent girls, women living in such circumstances are particularly 
at risk for sexual violence, especially when they sleep in the open or in 
insecure dwellings, collect water, or defecate in the open. Densely populated living conditions in slums places them at risk for infectious diseases such as 
tuberculosis, acute respiratory infections, and various skin disorders. Further 
many urban poor live in city outskirts, low lying areas, near factories and construction sites and are at risk for floods and outdoor air pollutants. 
Urban poor are a diverse group of vulnerable populations such as homeless, 
rag-pickers, street children, rickshaw pullers, construction, brick and lime kiln workers, sex workers and temporary migrants. We can categorize the vulnerable 
urban groups based on the nature of their vulnerabilities.

urban persons/households who are houseless, living in kutchha/
temporary houses, facing insecurity of tenure, and un-served 
or under-served with basic public services like sanitation, clean drinking water and drainage. 
ii)  Social vulnerabilities point to gender-based vulnerabilities such as those faced by female-headed households, age-based vulnerabilities such as minor-headed households and the aged, and health 
vulnerabilities such as disability and illness.
iii)  Occupational vulnerability is faced by persons/households who 
are without access to regular employment, susceptible to significant 
periods of unemployment, as well as those due to no access to 
skills training and formal education or the stratifications of gender, religion and caste, are ‘locked into’ certain types of occupation 
such as informal and casual occupations with uncertain wages/
earnings and/or subject to unsanitary, unhealthy and hazardous work conditions, oftentimes bonded/semi-bonded in nature or 
undignified and oppressive conditions.
Different vulnerable groups according to the vulnerability criteria

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,44,"44
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasHow to reach those vulnerable?
To work effectively as an ASHA in urban areas, you need to reach and identify 
these groups and their specific health issues. These marginalized people/
families have little information and knowledge on their health rights, 
entitlements, and the benefits of preventive health services. Due to their complex circumstances, they remain out of reach and invisible to the health 
system or health service providers.
However, it is they who are most in need of information and services. 
Unfortunately, these families stay uncounted because they are invisible and 
unreached. The beliefs, fears and apprehensions of such families are genuine. 
You need to build a bond of trust with them so that you help them overcome constraints and enable them to access health services.
During this process of mapping, you need to identify vulnerable with respect 
to access to piped water supply, sanitation facilities, food security entitlements, type of occupation, legal status of the land and rents and the recognition of 
their identity by governments. Mapping must carefully identify slums which 
have not been notified and illegal settlements where peoples live, and relate it to the services they are provided (Refer Annexure 12). 
Identifying vulnerable: Your roles
Mapping You must first of all map those households and families which fall in the 
categories discussed above, where you know that such families do not access 
health services readily. Identify those households among whom social exclusion and lower health service use is concentrated. 
Prioritizing 
You must then prioritize home visits to such families. Ensure that you spend time in understanding specific constraints and help them to access health care 
services, especially for mothers and children. 
Communicating 
You should inform them about why these services are needed, where they are 
available, and what their health entitlements are. 
Understanding 
Often people have rational reasons and legitimate concerns for why they are 
not able to use health services. Do not assume that their attitudes are bad. You 
may have to explore options for changing the way existing services are being provided. For instance, in some cases the ANM will need to make a home visit "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,45,"45
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasto provide Antenatal and post natal care, and immunization or the anganwadi 
Worker or her helper will have to deliver the Take Home Rations to the 
household. 
Counseling 
Listen to people’s problems, build a relationship of trust, and work with them to 
find solutions. You could accompany them to the UHND or the health facility so 
that they feel comfortable and confident about accessing them on their own in the future.
Persisting 
Changing behaviors is not very easy to do, especially among poor and marginalized families, who may not perceive the immediate gains or for 
whom there are other more important priorities. It needs repeated visits and 
counseling. Keep in mind that once the families overcome their reluctance to adopt preventive and promotive health behaviours and begin to access health 
services, your need for frequent visits will reduce. 
Coordinating 
It is quite likely that there still remain families, who despite your persistent 
efforts will not access services. You can ask members of the Mahila Aarogya 
Samiti, or request your Facilitator or the ANM, who may be in a position to influence these families, to accompany you on a home visit. 
Mobilizing 
Getting people together gives people the confidence to change. Organization provides strength. Building solidarity creates confidence. Leadership provides 
inspiration and optimism to break out of age old inertia. So, organize meetings, 
join together to sing songs, take out a rally, and celebrate survival. Mobilization is the most important tool of all."

Knowing About Health, 
Hygiene and IllnessSection 5
You have been introduced to various determinants of health. This 
section will help you understand in detail the role of food and hygiene in 
maintaining good health.
Role of Diet and Food in Maintaining Good Health
We all know that we need food to give us energy, live and grow. Our 
regular requirement of food depends on the stage of our life and the 
amount of work we do. To grow better we need sufficient amounts of 
food rich in all essential elements. 
A newborn needs only mother’s milk till six months of age and needs 
it frequently. After six months the child needs complementary feeding 
and can gradually learn to eat all that adults eat, though it should be given in smaller amounts and more frequently. 
Food requirements of a pregnant mother are higher than other women.
The important qualities of our food are related to the nutrition it 
provides, its quantity and frequency.
What constitutes good food? 
Major constituents of the balanced diet and their functions are:
l Proteins: Important for body growth and strength. Milk, Pulses and beans are plant sources and animal sources 
include eggs, poultry products, all kinds of meat products 
and fish.
l Carbohydrates*: Form the bulk of our food and the main source of our daily energy needs. This we get mainly from 
cereals like, rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, ragi, bajra. Tubers 
like potato also provide carbohydrates.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,48,"48
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Fat (from oils and ghee) – Provide extra energy, 
and are good especially for children, as they give 
more energy as compared to cereals. Fat cells 
stored in our body also act as an insulation to protect it from heat and cold. They also help in 
absorption of certain Vitamins like A and D. Fats 
are derived from sources like oil, butter, ghee,  nuts etc.
l Vitamins and Minerals – They are essential nutrients required in small quantities and help 
fight diseases. Present in vegetables, fruits, 
sprouts. Calcium, iron, iodine and zinc are some key minerals required by body. 
l Fibres or roughage and plenty of water –  Are also essential for a healthy body 
* (Traditionally communities used to eat more coarse cereals like sorghum (called Jowaar), maize, ragi, and bajra. Wheat and Rice became popular in our country 
only in recent decades. The traditional cereals are richer 
in nutritional value and were more easily available to all sections of society as they were grown easily and were 
cheap. All cereals when eaten in less polished form, retain 
more nutritional value.)
Good Dietary Practices –These include eating a 
balanced diet which is full of all essential components 
of food in right proportions. Frequency of meals is also an important aspect. Children and Pregnant 
Women should have more meals. Having a balanced 
mix of different food items like cereals, pulses, green vegetables and fruits is good for our health.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,49,"49
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRole of Personal Hygiene and Clean Surroundings in 
keeping Good Health
Personal Hygiene and cleanliness are not only essential to a good quality of life, 
they are also closely related to maintaining good health and preventing disease. 
“Gandhi Ji said that Cleanliness is next to Godliness.” 
Many infections spread either through unhygienic surroundings or poor 
personal hygiene.
Faeces
Flies
Food
MouthWater Hands
The illustration above shows the many ways in which the disease causing organisms spread from human faeces into the food we eat and the water 
we drink. To save ourselves from diseases we have to check these routes of 
infection with changes in our day to day hygienic practices.
Common measures adopted to ensure good health
A) Personal measures
i) Hand washing
l The simple practice of hand washing can stop the spread of diseases very 
effectively. 
l Hands should be washed regularly at all times with soap, especially after defecation and before preparing, serving and eating food. 
l Soil should not be used to wash hands, because it is often contaminated with harmful micro-organisms. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,50,"50
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Hand washing can be done with ash, but for this ash must be fresh from the 
fire. Because it is difficult to ensure that the ash we are using is fresh and 
uncontaminated, its use must be discouraged.
l For hand washing to be effective it must be done properly and all 6 steps of 
hand washing must be followed every time. Refer Annexure 8 for details.
l Hand washing will not be effective, as long as our nails are not cut. Spaces between the nails and fingers collect dirt. 
The two practices of using clean toilets and hand washing, together can stop the spread of many communicable diseases to a large extent.
ii) Maintaining hygiene of other body parts
l Skin: Cleanliness of skin is essential for overall body hygiene and is particularly important in a hot country like ours. A daily bath with soap and 
water and thorough cleaning of hands, feet and face helps in removing 
sweat and accumulated dirt. Dirt makes the body a breeding ground for harmful bacteria. Wearing clean, dry clothes and footwear help us remain 
clean and keep away many skin infections. A daily change of clothes, 
particularly undergarments, is a good practice. 
l Teeth and gums-Teeth should be brushed regularly at least twice every day, using a soft bristled brush. Brushing removes food particles accumulated 
between our teeth and prevents the growth of bacteria which cause cavities 
and gum disease. 
l Hair: Keeping hair clean by regular wash with a mild shampoo/soap is important to avoid infections and infestation by head lice.
B) Measures pertaining to our surrounding
i) Using clean toilets
The practice of open defecation is common in our rural areas as well as in many 
of the urban pockets. Due to this, harmful organisms contaminate the soil and 
water sources. Use of sanitary toilets by all will stop this faecal contamination. As an ASHA you should work with the MAS in ensuring that all households have 
access to sanitary toilets and use them regularly. There are many government 
schemes that provide support for construction of toilets. 
ii) Safe handling of food and water
Safe handling of food and water also prevents many diseases. This can be achieved 
through:  
l Cleaning of the food items before cooking or consuming.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,51,"51
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Keeping the food covered, away from dirt and flies.
l Avoiding consumption of partially cooked meat, eggs and unboiled milk.
l Using clean utensils for storing, cooking and consuming food. 
l Drinking water from clean water source.
l Storing water in clean, covered pots.
l Using a long handle ladle or a utensil with a tap to take out water to prevent 
contamination. Benefits of clean water source like hand pumps are often 
lost when the water is not handled properly.
iii) Sanitary disposal of solid and liquid waste 
Accumulated solid and liquid waste is a breeding ground for many disease causing organisms. This should be checked through:
l Preventing collection of solid waste in the surroundings- Decaying 
solid waste is a breeding ground for many vectors like housefly, rats, kala-
azar etc. Support of MAS should be taken for arranging regular disposal 
of solid waste. You should facilitate community sensitisation against poor environmental hygienic practices. Waste disposal measure such as 
‘composting' can also be encouraged.
l Preventing pooling of wastewater in our areas- It is a health hazard as it 
acts as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other harmful organisms. It 
also creates problems in movement of people and is dangerous particularly 
for children .
l Stopping water logging around water sources like hand pump or wells- The waste water from houses also adds to water logging if there are no 
provisions for proper drainage.
l Making kitchen gardens and Soak-pits around sources of waste water- 
These are easy methods for disposal of wastewater. Kitchen gardens for 
growing vegetables and fruits help in absorbing extra water. In urban areas 
finding small places around every house for kitchen gardens may not be difficult. Soak-pits are a good way to stop pools of water, particularly in 
streets and common pathways. They absorb water without forming a pool. 
(Annexure-9 shows you how make a soak-pit)
l Creating drainage systems- Apart from these measures, our area may still need a proper drainage system. These can be both open and covered 
type. Open drains require much more regular cleaning to avoid chocking 
of water flow. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,52,"52
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasWhat is Illness/Disease/Sickness
Disease is an abnormal condition affecting the body. Disease is often used 
to refer to any condition that causes pain,  dysfunction,  distress,  or death to 
the person afflicted. It usually affects people not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically, as diseases can alter one’s perspective on life and their personality.
Diseases can also be classified as communicable and non-communicable 
disease.
Communicable diseases – These are diseases that spread from one person 
to another either directly such as coughing and sneezing or through a carrier 
such as a mosquito or flies. Some examples of such diseases are: Common colds, (directly) Diarrhoeal diseases (flies), Malaria (mosquitoes), and Tuberculosis 
(directly). Steps must be taken to prevent their spread from the persons 
affected to other people in the community.
Non Communicable diseases – They are usually associated with people’s life 
styles (tobacco, alcohol, obesity), pollution, and deficiency or excess of some 
nutrients. They never spread from one person to another. Some common examples are high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and many other 
illnesses. 
In our community we may notice some people living with various physical and 
mental disabilities such as deafness, blindness etc. Physical and mental injuries 
due to accidents such as road accident/accidents which occur at work and 
animal bites also belong to this category. 
Healing 
Our body has its own defence, or way to resist diseases and heal itself. In most 
cases, these natural defence mechanisms are more important to our health than medicines. 
Have you seen how a tree heals its axe injury? First the gum fills the gap. The gum 
hardens and gradually becomes wooden. A similar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. 
Even in a case of more serious illness, when a medicine is needed, it is the body 
that must overcome the disease; the medicine only helps. Cleanliness, rest, adequate nutritious food and water are essential to help the patient recover 
from the disease and live a healthy life. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,53,"53
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasOur body has its own defence mechanism (immunity) which fights against 
germs or diseases causing organisms. This system matures as body learns how 
to fight germs. This helps us recover from an illness. The severity and duration of 
illness vary with the type of the pathogen and defence mechanism of the body to resist the infection.
Note – Components of mother’s breast milk enable baby to fight many illnesses. 
The first thick milk (colostrum) is a priceless shield for the baby and should never be discarded. 
In case of non- communicable diseases adopting an active and healthy life 
style is the key to prevent, reverse or minimise the symptoms of the diseases. Medications and supplements may also provide help in reducing the effects of 
such diseases. In some severe conditions surgeries may be required. 
Treatment for Diseases
Healing with traditional medicines
There are certain traditional ways of healing and treating illnesses. 
The traditional systems of medicines include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, 
Siddha and Homeopathy. There are also home remedies which are 
passed on through generations. Many of these are of great value, cheaper and do not have harmful side effects as only natural herbs 
and therapies are used in making them. Some diseases are helped 
by traditional medicines, while others can be treated better with modern medicines.
Treatment with modern medicines
For first contact care we need very few medicines. As an ASHA you will learn to use some medicines/drugs. For example: 
Paracetomol, Chloroquine, Iron Folic acid and ORS.
The use of each drug; its dose, how many times to be given, 
side effects, and precautions are given in Annexure 8. Read 
this carefully before using the drugs. These medicines are safe, cheap and very 
effective. We will learn about some more medicines in the subsequent trainings.
Modern medicines have side effects. Thus it is important to use them rationally 
and prevent injudicious usage.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,54,"54
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasASHAs Role in Promoting Rational Drug Use
Spread awareness in the community on 
Avoiding overuse of injections and saline (bottle)
Try to overcome the prevalent belief that injections and saline are always necessary. Some 
patients insist on injections and saline bottles. Many doctors are also driven by profit 
motives. You should educate people that these are useful only in certain conditions. People can save expenses with help of simple remedies. The saline in the bottle is just water, salt 
and some sugar. If we prepare it at home and take orally the effect is the same.
Preventing misuse of Tonics
Many doctors prescribe these tonics, because patients ask for them. Tonics are not 
necessary for the growth of body or to give energy. They are just a combination of water, 
sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In most of the cases, for gaining strength and ensuring growth a simple nutritious home cooked meal is enough.
Avoiding self-medication
People often buy medicines by themselves or use any medicines lying in the house for 
conditions such as fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headaches. This should not be 
done. Most drugs cause side effects, and some are harmful. The side effects of some of 
the commonly used medicines used in self-medication are:
l Drugs used as pain killers: Almost all painkillers cause irritation of stomach and many of these, when taken over long periods, can cause internal bleeding and 
stomach ulcers.
l Anti-allergic drugs: Are used in the treatment of cold and cough and can cause 
sleepiness, which can sometimes cause accidents.
l Antibiotics: Antibiotics might cause life-threatening ‘reactions’ if a person is allergic to 
them. Some antibiotics can disturb intestinal bacteria and induce diarrhoea.
Many drugs affect our vital organs, like the liver and the kidney as these organs flush out drugs and toxins from our body. Some people also treat children with the same medications which have been prescribed to adults. This is dangerous since children 
need much smaller doses. Doses are given according to the body weight. Most 
importantly, pregnant women should not take any medicine without consulting a qualified doctor, as these could harm the unborn baby. 
Taking correct dose of medicines
Both overdose and inadequate dosage can be harmful, especially in children. People 
should strictly adhere to dosage and schedule of drugs as recommended by the doctor. 
Education about rational drug use in community will help you in your work. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,55,"55
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasFever
Fever is a common symptom of many diseases and not an illness on its 
own. Some mild fevers subside without any treatment or treatment at 
home. Such fevers are not accompanied by cough, ear discharge, rash 
diarrhoea or any other sign of obvious infection in any organ. However, in many cases it may be a symptom of an acute severe illness.
For healthy individuals of 18-40 years of age, the mean normal oral 
temperature is just above 36.8°C (plus or minus 0.4 degree celsius) or 98.2 °F (plus or minus 0.7). After an attack by germs, our body reacts by generating 
more heat and hence causing fever. But excess fever may be harmful and may 
lead to distress and several complications. 
Thermometer is used for measuring temperature and i t is wise to take a sick 
person’s temperature before deciding on further action.
Managing fever
l Fever associated with self- limited infections and lasting for one or two days duration: Needs no specific treatment. It is managed through taking 
r
est, drinking plenty of fluids like water, rice water, soup, buttermilk etc. and 
light meals. One should avoid taking oily or spicy food. 
 If patient is uncomfortable or has body ache or headache  you can provide 
Paracetamol* tablet for controlling fever and relieving symptoms. One 
tablet thrice a day is enough for adults. Give tablet Paracetamol for two days 
and refer if the fever persists ( See Annexure 8 for details)
l Persisting fever or fever with chills, rashes, drowsiness, stiff neck etc. This is associated with serious infections and n
eeds immediate referral to a 
hospital. 
(*Paracetamol tablet or syrup is a general remedy for fever. It only brings down the temperature. It is not a fever-cure since it does not eliminate the causative factors

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasIn case of newborns or small infants, any fever should be taken seriously. A 
baby has fever if the temperature is above 99 degree Fahrenheit( 37.2 degree 
celsius). If you are approached for the baby having fever; you should give the 
first dose of paracetamol and immediately refer to a hospital. See Annexure 8 for specific dosage and schedule.
Note: Fever a
bove 39.5°C (103°F) is high fever. Refer immediately any person 
with high fever after sponging and giving tablet Paracetamol.
For high fever in a child sponge the whole body with tepid water. Do not use cold 
water as it causes shivers. Do not cover with a blanket. Keep windows open and give 
enough water and fluids to drink.
Remember
Several serious illnesses may be connected with fever e.g. Malaria, Pneumonia, Pus (anywhere) Typhoid, TB, Kala-Azar, Filariasis, Brain Fever, HIV/AIDS etc. We 
will learn about them later. Even when we think it to be a mild fever and there 
is no sign of infection in any organ or loss of conciousnesess, do not wait for more than 2 days and refer. If any danger signs are seen refer at once to an 
ANM or a U-PHC.
Pain
Aches and Pain are one of the most common complaints and are sometimes 
associated with fever and other illnesses.
What is pain?
Pain is a signal that something is wrong inside our body. It is an unpleasant sensation which is associated with tissue damage.
The role of the ASHA in pain relief
Pain is only a symptom of illness, we need to find out the illness and treat it as soon as possible. 
In mild forms of pain where there is no injury or other symptoms like swelling,  
fever and body pains like headache, backache etc. you can give Paracetamol 
Tablet from your Drug Kit (Refer – Annexure 8 for dosage) and advise 
rest. 
Ayurveda suggests gentle oil message for body aches and back aches. 
If the pain does not subside in a day or two or gets worse, you can refer to the U-PHC. 
Immediate referral to a hospital is needed in the following cases:
l Any pain with convulsion, any severe chest or abdomen pain 
l Headache with neck stiffness 
l Any pain associated with burn injury and in joints. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,57,"57
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasCommon Cold and Cough
l It is the most frequent infectious disease in humans.
l No specific treatment exists but one can relieve the symptoms
l Common home remedies can be used for relieving the symptoms like 
honey, ginger, tulsi tea. 
l Giving lukewarm water to drink and maintaining proper nutrition is helpful.
l If the symptoms are severe, and if there is body-ache, or headache, tablet Paracetamol can be given. Refer annexure 8 for details.
First Aid for Injuries and Wounds*
Wound care
You may come across situations, where you will have to manage common wounds and injuries. This section would help you understand the management 
of different types of wounds.
Types of wound
Wounds are of three categories:
1. Wounds without bleeding 
2. Wounds with bleeding 
3. Infected Wound
1. Care of the wounds with no bleeding
These wounds include small abrasions, small cuts, scrapes and other small 
wounds. Prompt first aid can help nature heal small wounds and deal with germs. 
Bleeding is usually limited to oozing and is due to damage to minute blood 
vessels. Even these types of wounds need to be attended immediately as they may get contaminated and become infected.
Take the following steps while managing these wounds:
l Wash your hands using soap and water
l Clean the wound, using pre boiled and cold water (Soap can be used if the 
wound is contaminated with dirt. But remember excess soap may damage 
the flesh.) 
 Or,  gently w ipe the dirt away using cotton without rubbing it. Rubbing 
disturbs the clot and restart bleeding, thus delaying the healing process. Use 
different cotton swabs each time.
* Certain parts of this section have been taken from the book Where There is no Doctor."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,58,"58
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Place a piece of clean gauze or cloth over the wound. Cloth should be light 
enough to allow passage of air for quick healing. 
l Advise the person to change the gauze or cloth every day.
Remember
Any bit of dirt that is left in a wound can cause an infection. A clean wound will heal without any medicine. Cleanliness is of first importance in preventing 
infection and helping wounds to heal. If a person gets a cut, scrape or wound,  
he/she should be referred immediately to take Tetanus Toxoid injection.
Family members should be warned to:
l Avoid using animal or human faeces or mud on a wound. These can 
cause dangerous infections, such as tetanus.  
l Never put alcohol, tincture of iodine, or any medicine directly into a wound; doing so will damage the flesh and make healing slower.
l Avoid disturbing the scab (a dry covering over the wound) that has been formed.
l Visit a health facility if there is a deep/sharp cut for which stitches may be needed. 
 Refer persons to nearby health facility immediately in case the cut is large.
2. Care of the wound with bleeding: 
Minor bleeding is readily controlled by pressure and elevation. In such cases a 
small ashesive dressing is all that is necessary. Medical aid need only be sought 
if the bleeding does not stop or if the 
wound is at special risk of infection. 
Steps to control severe external bleeding from wound: 
l Raise the injured part
l Apply pressure on the wound directly by using 
your fingers or palm preferably over a clean sterile 
cloth/bandage. 
l Hold the pressure. Don't keep checking to see if the 
bleeding has stopped because this may damage or 
dislodge the clot that's forming and cause bleeding 
to resume.
l If the bleeding is severe take patient to the hospital immediately and keep the pressure on. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,59,"59
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl If the bleeding can not be controlled by pressing on the wound, or the 
presure point, and if the person is losing a lot of blood you can tie the limb 
as close to the wound as possible, keeping the wounded part raised.
 Do not make the tie so tight that the affected area becomes blue. For 
the tie, use a folded cloth or a wide belt; never use thin rope, string, or wire.
3. Care of the infected wounds
Any wound which is red, swollen, hot, and painful with pus, or a foul smell is an 
infected wound. 
A deep bullet or knife wound runs a high risk of dangerous infection. You can 
know that the infection is spreading to other parts of the body if there is fever and a red line above the wound.
Wounds which may become dangerously infected are:
l Wounds with debris or made with dirty objects
l Puncture wounds and other deep wounds that do not bleed
l Wounds made where animals are kept: in cowsheds, pigpens, etc
l Large wounds with severe laceration or bruising
l Wounds due to bites, especially from dogs or other animals
l Bullet wound or knife wound 
Management of infected wounds
Infected wounds are serious and need immediate medical attention. Quick referral to a health facility for treatment with 
an antibiotic and injection for Tetanus Toxoid is needed. Leave 
the wound open and avoid covering the wound with bandages. Fresh air enables these wounds to heal faster.
Animal Bites
Dog bite and other animal bites
Dog bite is greatly feared because it can give rise to a deadly illness, which is called rabies. Rabies comes from the bite of a 
rabid or ‘mad’ animal, usually a rabid dog, cat, bats, fox, wolf, 
or jackal. This illness, affects the brain and nervous system. No cure is available for rabies. Anti- Rabies Vaccine (ARV) immediately 
after the dog bite can prevent this fatal illness. These vaccines are 
available in government hospitals. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,60,"60
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasSigns of Rabies
In the animal
l Acts strangely –sometimes sad, restless and irritable
l Foaming at the mouth, cannot eat or drink
l Sometimes the animal goes wild (mad) and may bite anyone or anything 
nearby. The animal may also become sleepy.
l The animal dies within 10 days
In People
l Pain and tingling in the area of the bite
l Irregular breathing, as if the person has just been crying.
l Initially, the person is afraid to drink water. Later he becomes afraid of water.
l Pain and difficulty in swallowing. A lot of thick, sticky saliva.
l The person is alert, but very nervous or excitable. Fits of anger between periods of calm.
l As death nears, fits (convulsions) and paralysis.
Note
l A bite can cause illness only if the animal itself is infected. Even a scratch on the skin or a lick on the open wound may give rabies infection. 
l Rabies infection is likely if the dog dies within 10 days of the bite or if it shows or develops any signs of rabies.
l First symptoms of rabies in bitten person may appear, within 10 days or more after the bite. 
l Bite or saliva of a rabies patient is also infective. 
l The effect of Anti Rabies Vaccine reduces after a period of six months, so for any further occasions of dog-bite, fresh vaccination is necessary. 
Role of an ASHA
In case you are approached, provide immediate wound care and take the following steps:
l Wash the wound well with soap and water 
l Leave the wound open or tie a loose dressing
l Refer to a health facility where an anti-rabies vaccine is available and doctor present will decide whether this vaccine is to be given. Advice to take TT 
injections in case not vaccinated for tetanus before.
l If the bite is in the head, neck, shoulders and chest, bring the person 
immediately to the health centre for anti-rabies injection. Don’t wait for  
15 days."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,61,"61
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Suggest the family to keep the dog under watch by keeping it tied for 15 
days. If the dog dies within this period or develops abnormal behaviour, 
there is an increased risk in the individual to develop serious infection.
You should build awareness in the community regarding
l Vaccination of the dogs and other animals against rabies, as per the schedule. 
Usually rabies vaccine is effective for a period of six months or an year. 
l To keep children and family members away from any animal that seems sick or acts strangely.
l To avoid contacts with saliva, urine, or perspiration of the bitten person as these secretions are infectious.
l Identifying and killing rabid dogs is essential. Inform the appropriate authority if you suspect a sick or a rabid dog.
Spread awareness to avoid direct contact of saliva of such animals. It is the saliva of the animal that contains germs if infected by rabies
Burns
Burns are common injuries in India and women and children generally are the common 
victims. This is often due to the handling of gas or the pressure 
stove while cooking. Children may suffer scalds due to spilling of boiling liquids 
— like milk, oil, dal, tea etc. 
Common causes of burns 
l Kitchen accidents - commonly bursting of pressure stoves 
l Fire crackers 
l Explosion in work places 
l House fires 
l Chemical burns 
l Electric burns 
l Suicide attempts 
l Murder attempts 
Types of burns and care
l Minor Burns: Pour plenty of cold water on the affected part, apply gentian 
violet and use Tablet Paracetamol for pain relief. (Annexure 11 for dosage). 
If it gets infected or the healing is slow then refer.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,62,"62
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Deep Burns: These destroy the skin, expose raw flesh and cover large areas 
of body. Apply gentian violet, wrap the burnt part with clean cloth or towel 
and immediately refer to a health facility. 
 If you do not have Gentian violet, then cover it loosely with a cotton cloth or 
sheet and immediately refer.
l For Burns of joints or skin folds: i.e. between the fingers, in the armpit, or at other joints, insert gauze pads with Vaseline between the burned surface 
to prevent this from sticking together as they heal. 
Also, fingers, arms, and 
legs should be straightened completely several times a day while healing. This is painful but helps prevent scars that limit movement.
Inform the individual about the following burn care:
l Keep the burn as clean as possible and protect it from dirt, dust and flies. 
These can lead to infections in burns. Signs of an infection in a burn include 
- pus, bad smell and fever. Infected burns need special care with antibiotics. 
Refer the patient to the ANM or the nearest U-PHC.
l Never put grease, fat, hides, coffee, herbs, or faeces on a burn
l Any person who has been badly burned can easily go into shock because of pain, fear, and the loss of body fluids due to oozing from burn.
l  Badly burned person should eat foods rich in protein and drink plenty of liquid during the recovery period. In case of acute burns it is suggested that 
the burned person should try to drink four litres of fluid in a day for a large 
burn, and 12 litres a day for a very large burn.
 Spread awareness in the community to adopt following safety measures
l Don’t let small babies go near a fire 
l Keep lamps and matches out of reach of children
l Stoves and hot pans should be placed in a way that children cannot reach them
l Synthetic clothes catch fire quite quickly. They stick to the skin more easily. Advise people to always take care regarding their clothes and sari 
‘pallus’ etc. during cooking. 
l Over-pumping the stove before pinning and igniting is dangerous. ‘First 
pin and then pump’ is the correct method to light the stove.
l Sometimes burn injuries are intentionally inflicted (most often, on women). In such cases if you are aware of NGOs or counsellors that help such women, 
you should let the woman know. If necessary, the doctors will initiate legal 
measures in these cases."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,63,"63
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasYour role in prevention or management of Traumas and 
Injuries 
You may come across cases where people get injured due to any accident or fall 
or any disaster like fire, earth quake or floods etc. In such situations people may 
get the following type of injuries:
l Bruise - Bruise is a hemorrhage under the skin. 
l Wound - cuts and grazes are injuries to or through the skin, that can cause 
bleeding.
l Burns - caused by excess heat, chemical exposure or sometimes cold.
l Fractures - injuries to bones.
l Joint dislocation - A displacement of a bone from its normal joint, such as dislocated shoulder or finger.
l Concussion - A mild traumatic brain injury caused by a blow, without any penetration into the skull or brain.
l Sprain - caused by a sudden over stretching to muscles.
l Shock - A life threatening condition that develops when bpdy’s blood pressure drops to very low levels. Amputation - removal of a body extremity 
by trauma or surgery.
In these cases you can help the people who are hurt by providing first aid for 
wounds with or without bleeding. However in these situations, most people 
would require emergency care which can prove life saving for them. For 
instance, if the person is not breathing properly then his or her life could be saved by giving mouth to mouth breathing or Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation 
(CPR – chest compressions) immediately. In such emergency cases, you should 
reach out to the patients, call for ambulance and transfer patients to the hospital."

Common DiseasesSection 7
In this session you will learn about three infectious diseases - TB, Malaria and 
Leprosy
Tuberculosis
A minute germ (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) causes TB, and it can affect any part of our body. But lungs TB is the most common form. 
Modes of spread
It spreads from one person to other through tiny droplets in air, when breathing. A TB patient’s sputum has thousands of TB germs, and while 
coughing or sneezing the TB germs spread in the air. The germs also stay 
in dust for long and affect people. TB germs enter the lungs of healthy persons, when they breathe. Not all persons so affected will manifest disease. In a weak 
person the germs multiply and produce an illness. It may take months to 
develop illness after the germ has infected the person.
Common signs and symptoms
The symptoms of lungTB are:
l Cough with sputum for two weeks or more
l Pain in chest
l Sometimes the presence of blood stained sputum (haemoptysis) with symptoms like:
l Rise in evening temperature
l Night sweats
l Loss of weight
l Loss of appetite.
A person with cough for two weeks or more is a suspect for TB and should 
be referred to a U-PHC/Hospital for the confirmation of diagnosis. Sputum 
examination is main tool for diagnosing lung TB. X-ray and other investigations may be needed in cases when sputum test is negative and the patient continues to 
exhibit disease symptoms.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,66,"66
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasManagement of TB 
Both drugs and 
nourishment is needed for 
cure of persons infected 
with TB. Under current ‘DOTS treatment’ one has 
to take the medicines in 
front of a non-related DOTS provider who could be an 
ANM or MPW or an ASHA. 
The improvement occurs in few weeks. However, the 
full treatment takes 6 to 8 
months in most cases. It is critical to make sure that the patient completes the full treatment, otherwise he/she will not be fully cured and illness will come 
back and will still spread the TB germs. During treatment the sputum is tested 
periodically for germs of TB. 
Table B in Annexure 8 contains the details on side effects of common TB Drugs.
ASHAs role
l Identify and refer patients for suspected cases of TB
l If you are a DOTS provider you need to ensure compliance for the 
treatment- Make sure that medicines are taken regularly by the patient for 
6-9 months 
l Counsel on patient taking extra nutrition
l Build awareness to prevent spread of TB by telling infected persons:
l To cover the mouth with handkerchief while coughing and sneezing to 
halt spread of germs.
l To avoid spitting in nearby open space and prevent spread of infection covering his or her mouth with a clean cloth, especially while coughing. 
This prevents spread of droplets in the surroundings. The cloth should be 
washed in hot water or with disinfectant thoroughly on a regular basis. 
l To avoid close contact with spouse, children and infants and the elderly within the family for at least first two months after starting treatment. 
l About BCG vaccination at birth that prevents serious forms of TB. 
l Providing support and care to persons with TB and not stigmatising those affected.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,67,"67
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasLeprosy
What is Leprosy?
l It is a chronic infectious disease caused by a bacteria Mycobacterium leprae.
l It usually affects the skin and peripheral nerves, but has a wide range of 
clinical manifestations.
Common signs and symptoms of Leprosy: The signs differ greatly according to the person’s natural resistance to the disease. The first sign of Leprosy is usually in the skin:
l One or more white spots or dark coloured patches, with loss of sensation in the affected area of the skin.
l Body parts usually affected include hands and feet, face, ears, wrist, elbows, buttocks and knees. Loss of sensation could be so severe that persons with 
Leprosy sometimes burn themselves without knowing it.
l In advanced cases hands and feet become partly paralysed and claw-like. 
Fingers and toes may gradually become shorter and become stumps.
Modes of spread
Leprosy is spread by skin to skin contact, through sneezing and coughing. The germs are found in the inner lining of the nose and in the skin of untreated 
persons. Germs once inside may not manifest the disease up to a period of  
5-7 years.
Types of Leprosy
Paucibacillary: Usually single skin lesion is seen or those with two to five skin lesions
Mulitbacillary: When more than five lesions are present
Management
It Involves: Multi Drug Therapy (MDT) using combination of drugs. It is a long 
treatment and requires constant follow ups.
ASHAs role
l ASHAs are involved in the eradication programme for Leprosy to mobilise all suspected individuals for a medical examination and further management 
which includes completion of the long course of treatment. A good way to 
do this is ask anyone with skin lesion to show to a doctor especially if there is diminished sensation. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,68,"68
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Counselling for leprosy patients for regularity/completion of treatment and 
prevention of disability.
l You must include following key messages when you talk to people about Leprosy:
l It is the least infectious of all infectious diseases, and it does not spread through casual touch.
l It is completely curable with MDT.
l Early detection and regular treatment with MDT prevents deformities and disabilities due to leprosy.
l MDT is available free of cost at all Govt. health centres/dispensaries/hospitals on all working days.
l Social rehabilitation of the leprosy afflicted persons should be supported by all individual to prevent any sort of discrimination.
l Treated leprosy patients can continue to live at home and do normal work.
l Former leprosy patients with mutilated hands/feet who received treatment earlier do not suffer from active disease and do not transmit 
leprosy. They do not need MDT again.
Malaria 
What is Malaria?
Malaria is one of the major public health problems of the country. It is an 
infection caused by a parasite (micro-organsim) called Plasmodium. But it can 
be treated if effective treatment is started early. Delay in treatment may lead to 
serious consequences including death. Prompt and effective treatment is also important for controlling the transmission of malaria.
There are two types of malaria: Vivax and Falciparum. Vivax is not very 
dangerous but falciparum malaria can cause damage to the brain, liver and lungs.
How does it spread?
When the mosquito bites an infected person, the parasite enters the mosquito’s stomach. It multiplies in the insect’s stomach and later when it bites another 
person, the parasite enters the blood of the person along with the insect’s saliva 
and infects him/her.
Signs and symptoms
l The patient can have fever, high shivering and sweating, which can occur on alternate days (in Vivax type of malaria) and every day at a certain time with 
Falciparum type infection. Sometimes the patient has continuous fever.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,69,"69
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl Malaise and headache usually accompanies fever.
l Malaria affects more frequently and more severely children below five years, 
pregnant women, or patients who are already ill.
l Falciparum malaria can affect the brain: causing clouding of consciousness, fits, or paralysis leading to death.
In areas where malaria is highly prevalent, pregnant mothers and malnourished children are at greater risk.
Any person living in a malaria affected area, who develops fever must be 
suspected as having malaria. If fever is with chills and rigor and headache, it is 
even more likely.
Managing Malaria
How to confirm:  There are two ways of confirming malaria through blood test; 
(This will be taught to you in future trainings)
l Making a blood smear- Annexure 9
l Using the Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kit- Annexure 11
RDT is to be done or smears are to be taken before starting treatment. 
Treating Malaria
Paracetamol should be given for fever, and sponging with warm water should be done to bring down temperature when needed. If RDT is positive for 
malaria- Chloroquine or Artesunate Combination treatment (ACT) treatment 
should be given. Your local health department would tell you which of the two possible treatments should be chosen. If despite treatment fever does not 
begin to come down within two or three days, or persists even after a week, 
the patient must seek treatment from a hospital. (Treatment guidelines for Malaria are provided in Table C – Annexure 10)
Prevention of Malaria
Mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet climates. There are many types of mosquitoes, but only very few of them transmit the disease. The mosquito 
that transmits malaria is called Anopheles and it bites almost exclusively at 
night. It does not bite during the day. That is why sleeping under a bed net is a good way of preventing bites. The mosquito that spreads malaria breeds in 
clean water. In rainy season, wherever water collects, it forms a good breeding 
place for mosquitoes. It also breeds in well in streams, rice fields and  
over-head water tanks."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,70,"70
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasWays of controlling malaria: There are two ways:
Do not allow mosquito to 
multiply
l Not allowing water to stagnate, 
and pouring a spoon of oil 
over the water surface in small 
collections. This is enough to kill the mosquito larvae.
l Drying up or filling breeding pits.
l Enable cultivation of Gambusia fish or larva eating fish in ponds 
and Wells - these eat up the 
mosquito larvae. Also remove the grass and vegetation from banks of pond. Larvae find it difficult to breed 
if there is no vegetation and the pond edges are vertical.
l Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in one 
place and it should be flushed and cleaned once in a week.
Do not allow mosquitoes to bite by using
l Clothes that cover the body, like full sleeves shirts.
l Mosquito nets treated with insecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net 
may die later.
l Mosquito repellent, eg.burning neem leaves to drive mosquitoes away.
l Insecticide spray on walls and places where mosquitoes sit so that they do 
not reproduce and die before biting more people.
The role of ASHA in prevention of Malaria
l In the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme ASHAs are involved in diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases on a day to day 
basis. You are expected to screen for fever cases suspected to be suffering 
from malaria, using RDTs and blood slides and to administer anti-malarial treatment to positive cases
l During house visits and in the MAS meetings you should inform the community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. 
Encourage and help the Mahila Aarogya Samiti and the women’s groups 
or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. Where possible, ask those with fever, who you 
suspect of having malaria to go to the primary health centre.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasDengue
What is Dengue
Dengue is a viral disease and is transmitted by the bite of an infective mosquito. 
Dengue occurs in two forms - Dengue Fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever 
(DHF). Dengue fever is a severe , flu like illness but DHF is more severe which 
can cause death if it is not treated properly. However with prompt and proper management, death due to DHF can be avoided. 
How does it spread 
Dengue is transmitted to people by the bite of a mosquito (known as an Aedes aegypti) that is infected with dengue virus. The mosquito becomes infected 
with dengue virus when it bites a person who already has dengue or DHF. 
Infected person with Dengue becomes infective to mosquitoes 6 to 12 hours before the onset of the disease and remains infective upto 3 to 5 days. The 
mosquito can transmit the virus when it bites a healthy person after about a 
week of getting infected. Aedes mosquito is a day biter which means that it bites during the day time only. Dengue does not spread directly from person to 
person. 
Signs and symptoms
Dengue
l The most common symptoms of dengue are high fever, severe headache 
(frontal headache), backache, joint pains, nausea and vomiting, eye pain 
(pain behind the eyes which worsens with eye movements), and rash 
l Patient may also complaint of loss of sense of taste and appetite
l Measles-like rash over chest and upper limbs
Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)
l Symptoms of DHF during the initial stage are similar to Dengue fever. Thus 
DHF is characterized by a fever that lasts from 2 to 7 days, with general signs 
and symptoms that could occur with many other illnesses (e.g., nausea, 
vomiting, severe abdominal pain, and headache). 
l This stage is followed by hemorrhagic (bleeding) signs which include - tendency to bruise easily or other types of skin haemorrhages – red spots/
points on skin, bleeding nose or gums, and possibly internal bleeding. Skin 
of the patient may become pale, cold or clammy. 
l Patient can also have frequent vomiting with or without blood, rapid weak pulse and difficulty in breathing. S/he can also complaint about sleepiness 
and restlessness; and feeling thirsty/dry mouth. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,72,"72
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl If the hemorrhagic/bleeding manifestations are not corrected immediately, 
they can lead to failure of the circulatory system and shock known ad 
Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). This may also lead to death of the patient. . 
Dengue/DHF can affect all age groups & both sexes. But younger children are 
more affected by Dengue and deaths due to DHF are also more in younger 
children than older children and adults. 
Managing Dengue
In cases where symptoms suggestive of Dengue/DHF are present, the patient 
should be immediately referred for eary diagnosis and treatment. 
How to confirm 
Following investigations can be done to confirm the diagnosis of Dengue at the 
hospital:
l Tourniquet test (performed by inflating a blood pressure cuff to a point between the systolic and diastolic pressure for five minutes). It is considered 
positive when 10 or more petechiae/red spots per 2.5 cm2 are observed. 
In DHF , the test usually gives a definite positive test with 20 petechiae/red spots or more. The test may be negative or only mildly positive during the 
phase of profound Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS).
l All suspected cases of fever with bleeding should be investigated for low 
platelet count by blood test. 
l Blood test (known as MAC ELISA) can be done to test for antibodies (IgM) at some identified hospitals for Dengue and Chikungunya
Treating Dengue
Dengue Fever
There is no specific medication for treatment of a dengue infection and 
medications for symptomatic relief should be taken. Drugs like Paracetamol 
may be used to lower the body temperature. Aspirin and drugs like Ibuprofen/brufen (NSAID) etc should be avoided since it may cause gastritis, vomiting, and 
platelet dysfunction. Patient should also rest and drink lot of fluids 
DHF 
Hospitalization is frequently required in order to adequately manage DHF. There 
is no specific medication for DHF (like Dengue) but it can be effectively treated 
by fluid replacement therapy (IV fluids and blood transfusion) if an early clinical diagnosis is made. "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,73,"73
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasChikunguniya 
What is Chikunguniya?
Chikungunya is a viral illness that is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. 
The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes 
persistent, joint pain (arthiritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-
threatening.
How does it spread?
Chikungunya is caused by the chikungunya virus which is spread by the bite of an Aedes mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti. Humans are the major source, or 
reservoir of chikungunya virus for mosquitoes. Therefore, the mosquito usually 
transmits the disease by biting an infected person and then biting someone else. An infected person cannot spread the infection directly to other persons. 
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bite during the day time.
Signs and Symptoms
The time between the bite of a mosquito carrying chikungunya virus and 
the start of symptoms ranges from 1 to 12 days. Chikungunya usually starts 
suddenly with fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash. 
The most common feature of the disease is stooped or (contorted) posture of patients who have severe joint pain (arthritis). Frequently, the infection causes 
no symptoms, especially in children. Recovery from Chikungunya is gradual 
with persistent joint pain which may require medications for pain relief.. Managing Chikngunya
How to Confirm?
Chikungunya is diagnosed by blood tests (ELISA). Since the clinical appearance of both chikungunya and dengue are similar, it is important to do a laboratory 
confirmation especially in areas where dengue is common. Facilities of such 
testing are available only at few national level institutes. 
Treating Chikungunya 
There is no specific treatment for chikungunya. Supportive therapy that helps 
ease symptoms, such as taking medicines for pain relief like Ibuprofen/brufen non and getting plenty of rest, is advised. 
Prevention of Vector Borne Diseases 
All three vector borne disease discussed above – Malaria , Dengue and Chikanguniya are spread by biting of mosquitoes – Anopheles and Aedes 
respectively. These diseases can be controlled in the following ways:"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,74,"74
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasDo not allow mosquito to multiply
l Not allowing water to stagnate, and pouring a spoon of oil over the water 
surface in small collections. This is enough to kill the mosquito larvae.
l Drying up or filling breeding pits.
l Enable cultivation of Gambusia fish or larva eating fish in ponds and Wells - these eat up the mosquito larvae. Also remove the grass and vegetation 
from banks of pond. Larvae find it difficult to breed if there is no vegetation 
and the pond edges are vertical.
l Water in drains and canals should not be allowed to remain stagnant in one place and it should be flushed and cleaned once in a week. 
l Water in coolers, bird baths and plant pots or drip trays should be changed at least once/twice each week.
l Insecticide spray on walls and places where mosquitoes sit so that they do not reproduce and die before biting more people.
l In areas with occurrence of Dengue or Chikungunya, the commercially available safe aerosols (Pyrethroid-based) can be sprayed in bedrooms, 
including closets, bathrooms and kitchens (by removing/covering all food 
items properly) for a few seconds and close the room for 15-20 minutes. The timing of the spray should coincide with the peak biting times of the Ae. 
aegypti mosquito, e.g., early morning or late 
afternoon.
Do not allow mosquitoes to bite by using
l Clothes that cover the body, like full sleeves shirts.
l Mosquito nets treated with insecticides so that infected mosquitoes do not 
reach the sleeping person. The mosquitoes coming in contact with the net 
may die later.
l Use of mosquito repellent creams, liquids etc. Mosquito repellent, eg. 
burning neem leaves to drive mosquitoes away.
l Use tight-fitting screens/wire mesh on doors and windows
l Use of bednets for sleeping infants and young children during day time to prevent mosquito bite
The role of ASHA in prevention of Vector Borne Diseases: 
l In the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme ASHAs are involved in diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases on a day to day 
basis. You are expected to screen for fever cases suspected to be suffering 
from malaria, using RDTs and blood slides and to administer anti-malarial treatment to positive cases"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,75,"75
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl In areas where cases of Dengue and Chikungunya appear, you should 
inform the community about the possible signs and symptoms and 
ensure timely referral for early diagnosis and treatment. This is particularly 
important in cases of Dengue which can be fatal if not managed timely. 
l During house visits and in the MAS meetings you should inform the community about malaria, how to prevent it and what to do for fever. 
Encourage and help the Mahila Aarogya Samiti and the women’s groups 
or other community organisations to take appropriate collective action to prevent malaria in that area. Where possible, ask those with fever, who you 
suspect of having malaria to go to the primary health centre.
Addressing Non-Communicable Diseases
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are also known as Chronic Diseases. They 
are not spread by infection and cannot be transmitted like TB or Malaria. They last 
for long duration and generally progress slowly or they may result in more rapid 
death such as sudden stroke. The four main non-communicable diseases are:1. Cardiovascular diseases including hypertension
2. Diabetes
3. Asthma
4. Cancers
Some other common chronic diseases include epilepsy, stroke, mental problems etc.
There are certain factors such as a person’s family history; lifestyle and 
environment which increase the likelihood of non-communicable diseases. 
These are known as ‘risk factors’ and can be divided into two categories:
l Hereditary risk factors: These factors include age, gender, family history, ethnicity or race. 
l Lifestyle related risk factors: These include unhealthy diet, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, obesity and stress.
Individuals with family history of heart attacks, diabetes, cancers or asthma are more prone to develop non communicable diseases. On the other hand, the individuals with unhealthy life styles like consumption of tobacco, alcohol, oily 
and high fat foods or who develop high blood pressure, obesity and high blood 
glucose are particularly at risk of these diseases. 
The hereditary risk factors cannot be modified or changed but you can advise 
the individuals who have family history of non-communicable diseases to go "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,76,"76
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasfor regular screening or checkups especially after 35 years of age. You can also 
educate them to maintain healthy lifestyle and adopt healthy behaviors to 
prevent the occurrence of these diseases. As an ASHA, you should also know 
the nearest health facility where these patients can be referred for screening or treatment of the disease.

Maternal HealthSection 8
8.1 Care During Pregnancy/Ante Natal Care
Pregnancy is a natural event in the life of a woman. If a pregnant woman is in 
good health and gets appropriate care she is likely to have a healthy pregnancy 
and a healthy baby. 
Pregnancy diagnosis
Diagnosis of pregnancy should be done as early as 
possible after the first missed period. The benefit of 
early diagnosis of pregnancy is that the woman can be 
registered early by the ANM and start getting antenatal care soon. 
There are two ways to diagnose pregnancy early
l Missed Periods 
l Pregnancy testing- through use of the Nischay 
home pregnancy test kit (Annexure 11)
l The Nischay test kit can be used easily by you to test if a woman is pregnant. The test can be done 
immediately after the missed period. 
l A positive test means that the woman is 
pregnant. A negative test means that the woman 
is not pregnant.
l In case she is not pregnant and does not want to 
get pregnant, you should counsel her to adopt a 
family planning method. 
l The result of the test should be kept confidential.

Schedule of ANC visits 
Four antenatal visits must be ensured, including registration within the first 
three month period. The suggested schedule for ANC is as below:
to visit the Medical Officer (MO) at an appropriate health centre for the third 
antenatal visit, as well as availing of the required investigations.
Services to be provided during ANC (at the UHND or in the facility)
l  Complete history of the current and previous pregnancy , and any 
medical/surgical problem in the past should be obtained. 
l  Weight, blood pressure, blood test for Haemoglobin (to detect 
anaemia), urine test and abdominal examination should be recorded on 
every ANC visit .
l  100 Iron Folic Acid (IFA) tablets and Tetanus toxoid (TT) Injections. In the 
first pregnancy first TT injection is given as early as possible and the second 
is given four weeks after the first one. In the next pregnancy only one dose 
(booster) is to be given if the pregnancy happens in first three years of previous one.
l  Counselling on nutritious diet and proper rest.
By carrying out a complete pregnancy check-up, the ANM is able to detect 
problems and decide on referring the woman to a doctor.l  1st visit: Within 12 weeks—preferably 
as soon as pregnancy is suspected—for 
registration of pregnancy and first antenatal 
check-up. This is also the time when maternal and child protection card is to be

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasAnaemia - Anaemia is very common among 
women, adolescent girls and malnourished 
children. 
l Anaemia is due to a reduced level of haemoglobin in the blood. Haemoglobin 
is a substance in the blood that carries 
oxygen which is important for all body functions. The amount of haemoglobin 
can be tested by a simple blood test, which 
the ANM in the health sub-centre or a lab technician in a health facility will do. Low 
haemoglobin can lead to complications in 
pregnant women and can even result in the death of mother and baby. A woman 
with anaemia looks pale, feels tired, 
complains of breathlessness on doing routine work, and might have swelling on 
the face and body. 
l To prevent anaemia, all pregnant women 
need to take one iron tablet daily, starting 
after three months of pregnancy. In this 
way, she must take atleast 100 IFA tablets. 
l Anaemia which is mild or moderate is treated with iron tablets (more than 200 Danger signs during ante-natal period

l If the anaemia is severe, hospitalisation for blood transfusion will be required. 
l All pregnant women should be encouraged to take iron rich foods. These 
include as green leafy vegetables, whole 
pulses, jaggery, ragi, meat and liver etc as well as fruits rich in Vitamin C – mango, 
guava, orange and sweet lime etc. 
l While giving iron tablets, the woman 
should be advised that some side effects 
might occur. However, they can be 
managed in the following ways: 
l Nausea, occasional vomiting, mild diarrhoea - can be reduced by 
taking the tablet after meals. 
l Constipation - can be reduced by 
drinking more water and eating fruits. 
l Black coloured stools - reassure the woman that it is not abnormal.
l Iron tablets should not be taken with tea, coffee, milk or calcium tablet. "

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRole of ASHAs
l List all pregnant women: Ensure that you cover the women in the poorest 
families, and in the sections which tend to get left out, e.g. women from 
SC/ST communities, women living in hamlets far from the main city, or in 
hamlets that fall between cities, newly migrant women and women headed households.
l Early registration: Help pregnant women getting registered as early as possible but within 12 weeks of pregnancy. 
l Ensuring full ANC: You should educate women about the importance of the four ANC visits. Remind them when next ANC is due and/or escort them 
to UHND if they need such support. Ensure that all components of ANC are 
delivered and the Maternal Card is updated.
l Counselling for ante-natal care: Counsel the pregnant women and  family on:
l Importance of a balanced and nutritious diet: The diet of the pregnant woman should contain a mix of cereals, pulses (including 
beans and nuts), vegetables, milk, eggs, meat and fish. If possible, the 
mother should be encouraged to add oils, jaggery and fruits to the diet. You should explain to the mother and family that no foods should be 
forbidden during pregnancy.
l Importance of adequate rest and harmful effects of heavy manual 
labour: Pregnant women should not carry out heavy manual labour, like 
working on construction sites, brick kilns, etc and take adequate rest for 
better growth of the baby.
l Danger signs during pregnancy: If she has any of the danger signs discussed earlier she should be referred to the appropriate health 
facility. 
l Supplementary Ration from Anganwadi Centre (AWC): Ensure that all 
pregnant women receive this entitlement from their nearest centre. 
l Extra care for pregnant adolescent girls: They are more likely to be under-nourished and therefore suffer problems during delivery. They 
need extra help for safe delivery at a health facility.
l Safe institutional delivery: You should promote safe institutional 
delivery for all pregnant women in the community and help them in 
making birth plans for the time of delivery. During the pregnancy period 
itself, you should discuss this with the family.
l The available institutions providing different levels of care close to the community.
l Transport options available in the area.
l Estimated expenditure and possible funding sources if required."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasDelivery Care 
Some women are at a higher risk of developing complications during 
delivery and they must be specially counselled to go for institutional 
delivery. These include:
l Adolescent girls (below 19 years of age)
l Women who are over 40 years of age
l Women who already have three children
l Women who do not gain enough weight or have excessive weight gain. 
Delivery occurs normally after nine months of 
pregnancy. In case the delivery happens before time, special care for baby is required. You should 
motivate every pregnant woman in your area to go 
to an appropriate health facility for delivery since labour complications may suddenly occur even if 
the pregnancy was normal. These complications can 
threaten the life of mother, baby or both. The priority is to ensure that the mother is shifted immediately to 
a well-equipped hospital.
In case the family needs you to accompany them to 
the institution for delivery and it is feasible for you to 
do so, you should escort the family to the institution 
at the time of delivery. Pregnant women should get benefits under schemes like the Janani Sishu Suraksha 
Karyakaram (JSSK), and the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY). These are described in next section.
Some women choose to give birth at home even after much persuasion. 
Your responsibility in these cases to help the woman have a safe and clean labour, delivery and post-partum experience. The most important 
component of making a home delivery safe is to ensure that the delivery  
is conducted by a Skilled Birth Attendant such as ANM, staff nurse or  
doctor. Another important component is to have a plan for referral if complication arises."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasTwo important health schemes of the Government for the 
mothers and newborn
Janani Suraksha Y ojana (JSY)
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is an entitlement under the National Rural 
Health Mission (NRHM), whose objective is to reduce maternal and neo-
natal mortality by promoting institutional delivery among poor pregnant women. The entitlement is available to all women who deliver in public 
health facility regardless of their age and parity. JSY scheme provides for 
a cash payment for any poor woman who delivers in any public health institution or in any JSY accredited private institution. You as the ASHA 
are also entitled to an incentive of Rs. 300, if you motivate women for 
completing all ante-natal check ups and Rs. 300 for facilitating her delivery in health institution. Escort is voluntary and not mandatory for ASHA. In case 
of an urban area ASHA will get Rs. 200 incentive for motivating women for 
completing all ante-natal check ups and Rs. 200 for facilitating her delivery in health institution. In case of home deliveries only the BPL women are 
entitled for the cash payment. You will be told by your trainers during 
training about the specific scheme related entitlements in your state.
JSSK – Janani Sishu Suraksha Karyakaram
JSSK entitles all pregnant women who deliver in public health institution and 
all sick newborn to completely cashless services. The scheme was launched to eliminate the high out of pocket expenditures made by poor families for 
accessing health care services at public health institutions.l Clean hands

Y our role – You should inform the community about these schemes and their 
entitlements. You should make them aware that they do not have to make any 
formal or informal payments at the facility for accessing delivery services or for treatment of sick newborn (0-30 days of birth). You should help them in getting 
these entitlements and also start action if there is any denial of services or 
demand for payment. 
Post-natal Care
Post-natal period is the period after delivery of the placenta up to six weeks (42 days) after birth. During this period mother and newborn could get some 
problems. You should be aware of these, so that they 
can be guided for treatment and referral. 
Tasks of ASHAs during this period
Home Visits
l  You should visit the mother and newborn from the time of birth till six weeks after the delivery 
and provide counselling for appropriate care of 
the mother and newborn.

l For Institutional Delivery visit on Days - 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42.
Important messages for post-natal mothers
Counsel the mother on following:
l  Nutritious diet: Counsel the mother to eat more than her usual diet .She 
can eat any kind of food but it is important to include high protein food like 
pulses and legumes, foods of animal sources etc. and plenty of fluids. 
l  Adequate rest: Encourage her and the family to let her rest for at least six 
weeks after birth
l  Exclusive breastfeeding: (details would be discussed in subsequent chapter)
l  Adopting family planning methods/contraceptives: Help the couple in deciding the method best suited for them and help them in accessing the 
required contraceptive services. 
l  Postnatal check-ups: Counsel the mother that she must be seen by the 
ANM for at least three post-natal check ups.
l  Timely birth registration: This is done by the Panchayat. Support her if she needs it. 
l  Free supplementary food from Anganwadi centre: You should inform and ensure that every lactating mother is aware of this entitlement and gets 
the services, by working with the Anganwadi worker. 
l  Possible complications of this period: You should inform mother for signs 
of complications (discussed below) and ensure appropriate referral
Complications during post-natal period
Some women can develop complications after the child birth. You should look 
for the following symptoms during this period to identify complications :
l Excessive bleeding 
l Fever 
l Foul smelling

Newborn CareSection 9
Every newborn needs care immediately at birth and in the first 28 days of life, 
irrespective of mode of delivery or weight of baby. In this section you will learn 
the basic aspects of the newborn care. Future rounds of training will cover 
this topic more extensively and help you build additional skills for providing newborn care.
Care of the Normal Baby
Immediate care of the newborn at birth
Immediate care at the time of birth involves clearing the nose and mouth of mucous, to allow the baby to breathe. Sometimes, the 
newborn can die immediately after birth due to asphyxia (difficulty in 
breathing). The ANM or the doctors attending the birth usually clear the airway and resuscitate the baby. In case of a home delivery, where 
there is no skilled birth attendant you should immediately refer the 
baby to the nearest health facility, as in such circumstances the time to save the baby is very short.
Normal care at birth
l  Drying the newborn: Baby should be cleaned gently with a clean soft moist cloth and the head wiped dry with a dry soft clean cloth. 
l  Ensuring warmth: The baby should be kept warm and in close skin to skin contact with the mother. It should be wrapped in several layers of clothing 
or woollen clothing depending upon the season. The room should be warm 
enough for an adult person to just feel uncomfortable; free from moisture and strong wind. The family and mother should be counselled to avoid 
bathing the baby till at least first seven days after birth. A newborn loses 
body heat very quickly and if it is left wet or exposed, its body temperature may fall suddenly and cause sickness which can kill the baby. 
l  Early initiation of breastfeeding: Mother should be encouraged to start breastfeeding immediately after delivery. This is beneficial for both the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,86,"86
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasmother and baby since it not only makes the baby stronger but also helps 
in quick delivery of placenta and reduces bleeding. The first yellow thick 
milk of the mother known as colostrum should be fed to the baby and not 
discarded as it prevents the baby from infections. 
l  Avoiding pre lacteal feeds: Honey, sugar water etc. should not be given to the baby since they can cause infection or diarrhoea. Only breast milk 
should be fed to the baby. 
l  Weigh the baby: Baby should weighed immediately after birth. If the 
weight of the baby is 2500 gms then it is a normal baby. But if the weight is 
less than 2500 gms then special precautions have to be taken, which will be 
taught to you subsequently.
Home visits for the care of newborn
You should undertake home visits to ensure that the newborn is being kept warm and breastfed exclusively. Encourage the mother to breastfeed, 
discourage harmful practices such as bottle feeds, early baths, giving other 
substances by mouth. Frequent home visits will help you to identify early signs of infection or other illnesses in the newborn. 
For institutional births-visit on Days - 3, 7,14, 21, 28 and 42.
For home deliveries visit on Days - 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42.
Care of the High Risk Baby
A high risk baby is the one who is:
l  Having less than 2000 gms birth weight
l  Not able to suckle or breast feed properly on day 1.
l  Pre term baby - born before completion of  
8 month 14, days. 
These babies need extra care. You should visit such babies on daily basis in the first week after birth. Visit the baby once every 
three days until she is 28 days old. If the baby is improving then one visit is 
undertaken on the 42
nd day.
Care for the high risk baby includes:
l  Extra warmth: You can advise mother and family to adopt the Kangaroo care (Skin to skin contact)- method to keep the baby warm. Request the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,87,"87
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasmother to sit or recline comfortably if possible in a private place, and loosen 
her upper garments. Place the baby on mother’s chest in an upright and 
extended posture, between her breasts, so that the baby skin is in direct 
contact with the mother skin. Turn baby’s head to one side to keep airways clear. Cover the baby with mother’s blouse, ‘pallu’ or gown; wrap the baby-
mother together with an added blanket or shawl. If mother is not present 
then you can advise father or any other adult of the family to provide kangaroo care to the baby. The head of the baby should be covered with a 
cloth or cap to prevent heat loss.
l  Caution during bathing: For Low birth weight and Pre-term babies, 
bathing should be delayed after the usual seven days, till a steady weight 
gain is recorded and the baby attains a weight of over 2000 gms. 
l  Frequent breast feeds: Babies with low birth weight may not be able to 
breastfeed in the beginning and need to be given expressed breast milk 
using a spoon. As they gradually learn to suckle they should be put to breast 
as often as possible.
l  Early identification and referral for danger signs: Counsel the  
mother to identify the following danger signs. If any of the following 
danger signs appear in the baby then it should be immediately referred 
to a well -equipped health facility for proper care. 
l Poor sucking of breast 
l Pus on Umbilicus
l Pus filled boils
l Develops fever 
l Fast breathing/difficulty in breathing/chest wall in drawing 
l Develops diarrhoea or has blood in stool 
l Pallor of palms/soles (jaundice)
l Blue palms/solesl Remains excessively drowsy or cries incessantly
l Feels cold or hot to touch 
l Bleeding from any site 
l Abdominal distension/vomits often
l Abnormal movements (convulsions)
l No urine passed in 48 hours 
l Cracks or redness on the skin folds (thigh axilla/buttock)"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,88,"88
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasPrecautions during referral:
l  Choose the fastest mode of transport. 
l  Keep the baby warm during travelling. 
l  Mother should accompany and stay close to the baby and breast feed the 
baby whenever required.
Other precautions to be taken for newborn care:
l  The cord of the baby should be kept clean and dry at all times. Nothing should be applied on the cord of the baby, it should be kept clean and dry at 
all times. 
l  Nothing should be put in the eye of the baby.
l  Newborn baby should be kept away from people or children who are sick.
l  The newborn baby should not be taken to very crowded places. 
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding should be started within half an hour after the birth. Baby should 
be put to the breast even before the placenta is delivered. The first thick milk 
– colostrum - should always be fed to the baby. Many people discard this milk 
due to cultural beliefs but it should never be discarded. Colostrum builds the immunity of the baby and protects from diseases. 
Facts about breastfeeding
l  The baby should be exclusively breast fed till six months of age and no other outside feed should be given. 
l  Breast milk provides for all the dietary needs of the baby. It also provides sufficient water to the baby, thus baby should not be given 
water even on summer days.
l  It is safe, builds immunity against illnesses, helps in keeping the 
baby warm and helps develop a bond between mother and baby.
l  Feeding other than breast milk may cause infections and malnutrition due to poor nutritious content. The baby may have difficulty in digesting such 
foods resulting in diarrhoea and vomiting. 
l  Breastfeeding should be done as often as baby wants and for as long as the 
baby wants, through the day and night."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,89,"89
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl  The more often the baby is fed, more milk will be produced. 
l  Breastfeeding helps in contraction of the uterus, expulsion of the placenta 
and also reduces the risk of excessive bleeding after delivery. 
l  At six months of age other foods should be introduced. Breastfeeding can be continued till the child is 1-2 years of age. 
Correct positioning for breastfeeding
The mother’s hand should hold the baby supporting the baby’s bottom, and not just the head or shoulders. The baby’s face should face the breast, with nose 
opposite the nipple, chin touching the breast, mouth is wide open and the lips 
upturned. 
To obtain maximum benefit of breastfeeding, the baby should be held in the 
correct position and be put correctly to the breast. Explain to the mother the 
correct position for breastfeeding. The pictures below explain how the baby is held in different positions.
Breastfeeding Positions
Cradle Position Side-lying Position
Underarm Position Alternate Underarm Position
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,90,"90
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasMother should follow the following steps while breastfeeding the baby every 
time:
l  Clean the nipple of the breast with warm water before feed. 
l  Hold the baby horizontal on the lap or besides if the mother is lying on side. 
l  Hold the breast at the root of the nipple. Put the baby’s mouth to the breast so that the baby gets a full hold of the nipple now.
l  Make sure the baby’s head and body is held facing the breast without turn and twist. Support the baby’s head and bottom. 
Common problems in breastfeeding
Some mothers may find it difficult to breast feed their baby normally. You should counsel such mothers and encourage them. Listen to them, understand 
their problems and give advice clearly and simply. 
The common problems reported are:
l  Not enough milk 
l  Sore nipples and 
l  Engorged and painful breasts 
Encourage the mother to continue breastfeeding when she complains of not 
enough milk. Maintaining the correct position during breastfeeding will prevent 
sore nipples. If the baby is not able to attach, apply warm compresses to breast, gently massage from outside toward the nipple and express some milk until the 
areola is soft, then put baby to the breast, making sure that the attachment is 
correct. If the problem persists refer the mother to ANM for advice."

Infant and Young Child NutritionSection 10
Malnutrition
One-third of the world’s undernourished children live in India. About 46% of the 
children below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly 
one out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under 
nutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, 
adolescence and adulthood.
Facts about malnutrition in young children
l  Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the 
contributory factors to over half of all child deaths.
l  Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they find it more difficult to 
get healthcare and also there is less time for child care.
l  Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using their 
scarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition.
l  Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in their homes. Also at the home, not only the mother, but the father and the 
grandparents of the child, all become part of the dialogue.
l  It is easier to prevent a child from slipping into malnutrition than to reverse 
it once it is severely underweight. Hence, the focus should be on counselling 
every family with a young child below one year of age, because it is this 
time, especially in the age of 6 to 18 months that most children become malnourished.
Recognising malnutrition
It is difficult to recognise malnutrition just by looking at a child. Only very severe cases would show obvious signs of weakness or wasting by which time it is too "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,92,"92
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areaslate. Most children look normal but their height and weight when measured 
is less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child 
monthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the 
child can be classified as mild, moderate or severely underweight.
Sick children need special attention. However, families of all children especially 
children below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent 
malnutrition.
Six important messages for preventing child malnutrition
1. Exclusive Breastfeeding
l  Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; not even water should be added.
2. Complementary Feeding
l  At the age of six months, add other foods. Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least 
one to two years more. There are five things to remember about 
complementary feeding:
l Consistency: Initially the food has to be so_ and mashed. But later, anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less 
spices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. 
‘give daal not daal ka pani’ .
l Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as 
the mother.
l Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given 
should be equal to about half what the adult needs in terms of 
nutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has 
to be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day.
l Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family 
could add a spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever 
edible oil is available in the house is sufficient.
l Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the greener it is, or the more red it is the more its 
protective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, fish are liked by children 
and very nutritive and protective.
3. Feeding during the illness
l  Give as much as the child will take; do not reduce the quantity of food. After the illness, to catch up with growth, add an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a 
major cause of malnutrition."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,93,"93
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas4. Prevent illness
l  Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are six important 
things to remember which could prevent illness:
l Hand washing: before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s food, and after cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the 
single most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea. 
l Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of 
particular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.
l Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that 
cause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are 
more common and life threatening, than in normal children.
l Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and then repeated once every six months till five years of age. This too 
reduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in 
malnourished children. 
l Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during 
the illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more 
rigorous in hand washing and more careful in handling the baby. 
l Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of 
malnutrition. You should encourage parents and other family members 
to spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the 
child. Such children eat and absorb food better.
5. Access to health services
l Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. On the 
very first day of the illness, if you help the mother decide on whether it is a 
minor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be referred 
to a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.
l Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a 
much higher chance of the children being malnourished.
6. Access to anganwadi services
l The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the age 
of 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations. 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,94,"94
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasMalnourished children are to be given additional food supplements. For 
children below the age of two, take – home rations are to be given. Even 
pregnant women and lactating mothers up to six months are entitled to 
get food supplements in the anganwadi centres. _ Weighing the baby 
and informing the family of the level of malnutrition is another important 
anganwadi service. 
l The anganwadi is also the site where the Urban Health and Nutrition Day 
(UHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is given 
immunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) 
packets or drugs needed for illness management.
Note
Wasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families tend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very 
costly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally 
available nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors 
for the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could 
also be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.
Counselling on Malnutrition
All the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, 
many of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not 
be possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps; first an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding 
of this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.
For an analysis, we need to know the following
l  What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, 
moderately underweight or severely underweight?
l  What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?
l  What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?
l  What is the family’s access to the three key services? (ICDS, Health Services and Public Distribution Services)"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,95,"95
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasSkills in Eliciting Information
There is a skill of asking each question so as to get the right 
information.
What the child is being fed
l  Ask specifically what was fed in the last one day, starting from now and recalling backwards, till the previous day.
Things to notice: how many feedings in a day, how much in each feed, whether the child’s food included pulses, vegetables, oil.
l  Ask specifically about protective foods which are not given daily.
l  Ask about feeding during illness
Illness and treatment
l  Ask whether the child fell ill during past six months (ask specifically about diarrhoea, fever, cold and cough). Start with 
most recent illness, and then ask them to recall backwards –“ 
before this when was he/she sick? etc.
l  What actions did the family take during illness? Which provider did they go to?
l  What difficulties did the family face in accessing healthcare and how much did it cost?
l  What are the likely inessential services or expenditures which they are getting into?
Access to Anganwadi Services
l  Is the child taken regularly every month to the 
Anganwadi Centre (AWC) for weighing? Have they seen the growth curve?
l  Is the family availing of food supplements from the anganwadi, is it regular, reliable and of variety needed and reasonable quality?
Skill in analysis
Based upon the replies to these questions, you will form an understanding of the multiple causes of malnutrition in that specific c child. It is never one factor, 
it is many. Do not jump immediately to some point and start giving your advice. 
Ask all the questions, listen to the replies fully, think about it and then only give your advice.
Discuss what measures are needed in each case and how this is to be conveyed?"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,96,"96
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasGiven below are examples of understanding that 
ASHA formed in two children
Banu was a nine month old girl with moderate malnutrition. She is 
being breastfed and only this month was started on complementary 
food. She eats rice and dal from her parents’ plate while they are eating, 
once at about 10.00 am and then about 6.00 p.m. She had diarrhoea once, one month ago, but no other illness. You gave her ORS and she 
became alright with it. She does not go to the anganwadi or get rations 
from there. Her immunisation is on schedule. 
Rafay is an 18 month old boy who is severely underweight. He has 
no odema, but there is some wasting. He cannot go to the hospital 
because his mother cannot leave her younger child and she also has to go to work as she is the only earning member. Rafay is not being 
breastfed, but gets to eat roti, dal and vegetables. He eats about half a 
roti or one roti thrice a day. But his mother complains that he does not eat a lot and has very poor appetite.
He has frequent episodes of respiratory infection but no other illness. 
His immunisation schedule is complete.
How to give advice
l  First praise the mother for how well she is coping with the child and reinforce the good practices she is following. Praise must always precede 
any other advice."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,97,"97
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl  Then deliver each message as needed for that child in the form of a 
suggestion and ask whether they could implement it. Dialogue with the 
family explaining why the step is needed and how they could achieve it. If 
they are convinced, they would agree. If not convinced or unable to agree, move on to the next message. It takes more than one visit and one dialogue 
for families to agree, even if it was possible.
l  Then point out any harmful or wasteful practices, explaining why you say so.
l  Arrange for a follow-up visit to see how many practices have changed and 
to further reinforce the messages. Each family with a malnourished child 
needs to be met about once or twice a month.
l  Arrange for mother and child to meet the ANM or the doctor as required. 
Such a visit is required in the following circumstances: 
l  Any child who is severely underweight. If, in addition, there are danger signs, admission in a facility which manages such children would be 
desirable.
l Any child who is underweight, who does not gain weight even after a 
few months of trying to follow the advice.
l Any child who is underweight, who has fever, or chronic cough or persistent anaemia.
Even if the family is not going to see the doctor or ANM, do inform the Anganwadi Worker (AWW) and the ANM so that they can follow-up too.
This work is equally their work also.
How you should NOT give advice
Do not prescribe advice without dialogue—just telling families what to do 
would not help…
Do not give very broad and what can be perceived as ‘insulting’ advice like– 
“you must take care of your child, or you must keep the child clean, or you must give nutritious food etc.”
Anaemia in the young child
Anaemia is important to diagnose because it commonly comes along with malnutrition. It may be a cause of poor appetite. Blood 
testing is essential, but even in its absence based on observation of 
pallor alone, treatment can be started.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,98,"98
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasLooking for anaemia in children
Unusual paleness (Pallor) of the skin of the soles or palms is a sign of anaemia.
l  To see if the child has anaemia, look at the skin of the child’s palm. Hold the 
child’s palm open by grasping it gently from side to side.
l  Do not stretch the fingers backward. This may cause pallor.
l  Compare the child’s palm with your own palm and the palm of other children. If the skin is paler than of others, the child has pallor.
Treatment for anaemia is to give one tablet of paediatric iron daily. And also give one tablet of Albendazole for deworming once in six months. For a child less than two years, give half a tablet of Albendazole (Refer Annexure11 ). Iron 
rich foods are also needed for the young child. If anaemia does not improve, 
the child must be referred to a doctor for more complete blood tests and treatment.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasAssessment of Malnutrition
ALL sick children should be assessed for signs suggesting malnutrition.
Check for Malnutrition 
Look and Feel:
l Look for visible severe wasting.
l Look for oedema of both feet.
l Determine grade of malnutrition by plotting weight for age (with AWW)
Identifying visible severe wasting
l  A child with visible severe wasting is very thin, has no fat, and looks like skin 
and bones. Some children are thin but do not have visible severe wasting. 
This assessment step helps you in identifying the children with visible severe wasting who need urgent treatment and referral to a hospital.
l  To look for visible severe wasting, remove the child’s clothes. Look for severe wasting of the muscles of the shoulders, arms, buttocks and legs. Look at the 
child from the side to see if the fat of the buttocks is missing. When wasting 
is extreme, there are many folds of skin on the buttocks and thigh.
l  The face of a child with visible severe wasting may still look normal. The child’s abdomen may be large or distended.
l  Look and feel to determine if the child has swelling of both feet. Use your thumb to press gently for a few seconds on the upper surface of each foot. 
The child has oedema if a dent remains in the child’s foot when you lift your 
thumb.
Determine grade of malnutrition
The AWW uses a growth monitoring chart for every child. Every child in the area should be weighed and his/her weight plotted on the growth chart. There is a 
separate chart for boys and for girls under the age of five years.
How to plot weight for age and identify malnutrition
l  The left hand vertical line is the measure of the child’s weight.
l  The bottom line of the chart shows the child’s age in months.
l  Find the point on the chart where the line for the child’s weight meets the 
line for the child’s age.
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,100,"100
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasDecide where the point is in relation to the curves
l  If the point is below the bottom most (-3SD) curve, the child is severely 
underweight.
l  If the point is between 2nd and 3rd curve or exactly on the 3rd curve, the child is moderately underweight.
l  If the point is on or above the curve marked zero or between the curve zero and -2SD (second curve) or exactly on the 2nd curve, then the child is 
normal.
Community level care for a malnourished child
All children who are underweight, should receive the following
l  Nutritional counselling as discussed earlier
l  Prompt treatment for all illnesses
l  Periodic weight measurement to ensure weight gain and detect worsening 
early.
l De-worming tabs (Albendazole): Half tablet of albendazole for a child less than two years old and one tablet for all children above two. 
l Based on the prevalence of worm infestations in the different areas the State as per their guideline will decide the deworming regime for 
malnourished/anaemic children. (see-Annexure-11)
l Paediatric Iron and Folic Acid Tablets: Daily one for three months.
l A dose of Vitamin A: If this has not been given.
Remember
Those children who are moderately underweight should be taken to a 
24x 7 U-PHC or a higher facility for medical consultation. Children who 
are severely malnourished need prompt hospitalisation in a centre which 
manages such children. This is often the District Hospital. "

Immunisation is one of the most well-known and cost effective methods of 
preventing diseases. The six vaccine preventable diseases are: 
l  Tetanus 
l  Poliomyelitis 
l  Diphtheria 
l  Pertussis (whooping cough)
l  Measles 
l  Childhood tuberculosis 
The vaccines must be given at the right age, right dose, right interval and the 
full course must be completed to ensure the best possible protection to the 
child against these diseases. The schedule that tells us when and how many doses of each vaccine are to be given is called immunisation schedule given in 
table below. 
If a child is not given the right vaccines in time, it is necessary to get them 
started whenever possible and complete the primary immunisation before the 
child reaches its first birthday.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRole of ASHA in Immunisation
ASHA facilitating immunization in a slum(a) Make a list of pregnant women, 
newborns and children up to two 
years eligible for different vaccines.
(b) Visit all families once in six months 
at least to update this list. After 
every immunisation session (UHND) 
update both the household register and the child’s health card. 
(c) Ensure that immunisation is discussed during every home visit in homes where there is a child under one year 
of age.
(d) Remind mother when the immunisation is due and alert her to the date when the UHND is being held.
(e) If needed, escort the mother and baby to the UHND on the date when the 
vaccine is due. This is important for families who do not access services such 
as those from poor and marginalised communities.
(f ) Ensure that first dose of BCG and oral polio is given soon after the baby is 
born.
(g) Mobilising children for UHND:
(i) Find out from the ANM when her next visit is due. If ASHA has her 
mobile number, confirm it on previous or same day. 
(ii) You must ensure that poorest and most distant households receives special attention to access the service.
(iii) Some children are more likely to be left out than others. This includes 
physically or mentally challenged children, children of migrant families, 
children belonging to families considered of ‘lower status’ or different from the majority of the area. Such children and such families are said to 
be ‘marginalised’ . They need your special attention and assistance.
(iv) Some hamlets or urban slums/basti have neither ANM or Anganwadi 
centre/worker taking care of their health needs. As an immediate step 
to address the issue. This needs to be corrected. As an immediate step, 
a women representative of the hamlet/slum can be included into the ‘Mahila Aarogya Samiti’ . 
(v) The community health plan should help identify hamlets and communities that are under-serviced. We will learn about community health plans in a later module. "

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasCommon Childhood Illnesses
Diarrhoea 
Diarrhoea is defined as passage of liquid or watery stools more 
than three times in a day. Passage of even one large watery 
motion among children can be labelled as diarrhoea. Normally 
there are three types of diarrhoea: 
l   Acute watery diarrhoea starts suddenly and may continue for a number of days. Most of these are self-limiting and will last 
for three to seven days. 
l   Persistent diarrhoea: If the diarrhoea is of 14 days or more duration, the 
child has severe persistent diarrhoea and should be referred to hospital. 
l   Dysentery: The child who is passing blood in the stools has dysentery. This 
child also needs immediate referral
Diarrhoea is a major cause of death and disease among children under five years. 
Majority of the deaths in diarrhoea are due to dehydration (loss of water and 
minerals). Germs are the main cause of childhood diarrhoea. These germs come 
from unsafe drinking water, unclean feeding practices, bottle feeds etc. We can 
avoid these problems with help of families and the community in tackling hygiene 
and sanitation issues.
Four golden rules to follow if a child has diarrhoea  
l Continue feeding
l Give extra fluids
l Give ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution)
l Refer in case of danger signs 
l Continue Feeding
l If the child is breastfed, mother should continue breast-feeding 
whenever the child wants. 
l If the child has started consuming other foods, continue feeding small quantities of these items. 
l After the child has recovered from diarrhoea, it should be given more food than normal to recoup from the illness. 
l Give extra fluids: like Dal ka Paani, lassi and plain boiled water etc.
l Give ORS: Advise the mother to give Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) to the child in adequate quantities. Guide the mother for preparing ORS in the 
following way. "

(See in the diagram how a pinch of salt is taken with three fingers and how 
a spoon of sugar is measured). Alternatively, one litre of water with 50 gm of sugar (8 spoons) and 5 gm (a teaspoon ) of salt. A juice of half a lime can be 
squeezed in. Taste to see that it is not too salty, or too sugary. It should taste of 
tears. Spoon is taken as 5 ml. Measure this amount and ensure it comes to 5 ml.

Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI)
Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) is an important cause of 
mortality and morbidity in children. Most children up to the age 
of five years are susceptible to ARI. If not treated in time some of 
them develop pneumonia, which can result in death. If the child 
has some or all of the following symptoms along with cough then 
you should refer the child immediately to the health centre: 
l Fever 
l Difficulty in breathing
l Chest Wall in-drawing 
Serious morbidity and death are preventable if it is identified early 
and referred and treated in time. "

Adolescent HealthSection 11
What is Adolescence?
Adolescence (10-19 years) is a phase of life characterised by acceleration of 
physical growth and psychological and behavioural changes which brings 
transformation from childhood to adulthood. It is a transition period of life 
where an individual is no longer a child, but not yet an adult
Developmental changes during adolescence
As a part of growing up, adolescents go through puberty. Puberty is the time in life when body changes from that of a child to an adult. These developmental 
changes occur under the influence of chemicals in our body called hormones. 
The changes are:
l  Physical Changes 
 In Girls: The body changes shape by becoming more rounded, the breasts 
grow, the hips widen, hair grows in the armpits and private parts. This 
happens between 10-16 years of age. The onset of menstruation (bleeding every month) is an important change occurring among girls during the 
adolescent years.
  In Boys: The shoulders widen, height increases suddenly, the voice changes 
and becomes deeper and hair begins to grow in the armpits, private parts 
and the face.
l  Emotional Changes: Include shyness, rapid mood changes, lack of 
confidence, attention seeking behaviour, strong peer influence, sexual 
attraction, desire to establish own identity and independent thinking. During 
this period unhealthy habits like smoking and drinking or experimenting with drugs and unsafe sex can also set in.
l  Social Changes: Conflicts with the family over control, strong influence of the peer group on behaviour and the formation of new relationship."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,110,"110
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasWhy is it Important to Focus on Adolescent Health?
Adolescent years are formative years and set our physical, emotional, and 
behavioural patterns. Foundations of future health are laid in this period. 
Increasing awareness, practice of healthy behaviours, building self- esteem and 
confidence in this age group results in confident healthy adults.
Major adolescent health concerns
There are certain health issues which are specific to this age group and have to be managed appropriately. These include: 
Menstruation in girls
(Understanding Menstruation and Problems during menstruation)Menarche: The onset of puberty, when the girl has her first period is called 
Menarche and generally takes place between 9-16 years of age. During this 
period, most girls have bleeding for the first time from the vagina which becomes a periodic occurrence in a girl’s life. Each cycle of bleeding is observed 
in a gap of 28-40 days.
Why does menstruation occur?In a girls’ body at puberty, every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of 
the eggs from the ovary, travels through pipes called fallopian tube. This is 
called ovulation. As the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a soft spongy lining Note:
l The normal time for onset of puberty is 10-14 years in girls and 12-16 years in boys.
l  These changes start 1-2 years earlier in girls as compared to boys. The rate and extent of change is variable in different individuals. In a group 
of individuals who are growing together this variation often leads to 
anxiety –“Am I normal?” and needs reassurance.
l Any cases showing delay, such as- menstruation not starting by 16 years in girls needs referral to a doctor. 
l Early onset of puberty signs in girls (before eight years) and boys (before nine years) is also a matter of concern and should be referred for further 
examination."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,111,"111
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasgets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of tiny blood vessels. 
In case an egg and sperm meet to form an embryo, or a baby, that begins to 
grow in the uterus this lining provides the nutrition for the baby. If the egg is 
not joined by a sperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The unfertilised egg along with broken uterine lining is released as blood and flows out of 
the vagina. This bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called 
menstruation.

A menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. The typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short 
as 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which 
can vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.
Problems faced by girls during menstruation
The difficulties that girls may experience during menstruation are:Irregular Periods: For the first few years of menstruation, cycles are often 
irregular and usually become regular within two to three years after menarche. 
They may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). 
Heavy periods: Adolescents may have heavy periods lasting longer than eight 
days, often saturating the pad within an hour or passing large blood clots. This 
happens because of a slight imbalance in hormone secretion. It should normally stabilise in year or two. However, if this happens regularly, it leads to exhaustion 
as body is losing more blood than it is producing. The girl should then consult a 
doctor immediately.

and severe cramps during menstrual period. Usually, this lasts only for a day 
or two. For relief from these symptoms, a girl should try the  
following methods: 
l  Fill a rubber bag with hot water, wrap it in a towel and place it on the 
abdomen,
l  Massage the abdomen
l  Local remedies such as drinking hot ginger tea
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS)
This refers to a combination of physical and emotional symptoms experienced by women and girls during the menstrual cycle, usually just 
before bleeding begins. These symptoms include- temporary weight gain, 
feeling of heaviness in the body particularly breast, headaches, cramps, pain and mental irritability. It is important for you to make the girls understand 
that these symptoms begin five to seven days before the period starts and 
disappear before the bleeding begins. This can be managed with remedies for pain described above and eating a diet that is low in salt, and includes 
foods like leafy green vegetable and raw fruits and vegetables, which are 
low in sugar and high in fibre.
It is important for you to help the girls understand that menstruation is part of every woman’s life and there should be no 
shame or embarrassment around this. It is not to be seen as an obstacle 
to daily activities. There is no impurity or pollution associated with menstruation. Practices such as seclusion or staying away from school 
must be discouraged.
Staying clean during menstruation
Commonly women use a cloth which is folded and placed within the 
underwear, or passes over the private parts by means of a string tied around 
the waist. This cloth is washed and reused most of the time. A sanitary napkin 
is a pad worn within the underwear during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. Disposable sanitary napkins are more convenient and easier to use than 
reusable cloth. The blood is absorbed better and there is a feeling of dryness. 
When changed often, it can prevent infection and allows more mobility. It allows girls to take part in school activities."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,113,"113
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasIn some districts, government has launched a scheme to promote 
menstrual hygiene through distribution of Sanitary napkins.
If it is being implemented in your area you can obtain a stock of sanitary 
napkins from the ANM and store it for distribution to girls. Under this scheme, napkins are to be sold to the girls at a cost of Rs six per pack and for 
each pack sold you will get an incentive of Re 1.
1  The fund collected after the 
sale of the napkins needs to be returned to the ANM who will then provide you with more napkins (based on the demand) for further distribution.
Important facts related to menstrual hygiene
You should explain to adolescent girls:
l  Change the used napkin once it is wet. Wet napkin can cause irritation on the 
inside of the thighs and lead to infections.
l  Wash the body and private parts daily and during menstruation, the outer genitals should be washed from time-to-time to remove any blood that is 
left. Girls should wash their hands every time they change the napkin.
l  If the underwear is soiled, it must be changed. Otherwise this makes 
bacteria grow and cause infection.
l  Use a clean cloth pad if sanitary napkins are not available. Cloth should be changed three to four times a day in case of heavy periods and should be 
washed with hot water and soap and dried under the sun, stored in a clean 
dry place. 
l  Keep a track of their menstrual cycle so that they are prepared for the time when the bleeding starts. As periods can be irregular in the early years, they 
should be encouraged to be alert for the bleeding. If they are school going 
girls or plan to be out of home for a long time they should carry a sanitary napkin with them for changing.
l  To dispose sanitary napkins by deep pit burial. In areas where waste disposal mechanisms are in place, it can be wrapped in a used newspaper and 
thrown in the community dust-bins.
Role of ASHA pertaining to menstrual hygiene
l  Organise monthly meetings on a fixed day with adolescent girls to provide 
health education on issues of menstruation and hygiene, sell and promote 
the use of sanitary napkins and communicate other adolescent health 
information. The venue of UHND and MAS can be used for this purpose.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasSpecific concerns of adolescent boys
The boys also may experience anxiety related to that adolescent changes. 
Some of these include:
l  Erection of Penis- In response to thoughts, fantasies, temperature, touch or 
sexual stimulation, the penis fills the blood and becomes hard and erect. 
In young adolescents erections may take place even in absence of sexual 
thoughts or stimulation and is a natural phenomenon.
l  Ejaculation- The release of semen from the penis is called ejaculation. This may occur at night and is commonly called a ‘wet dream’ . It is a natural and 
normal phenomenon- not a fault. 
Building the awareness of boys pertaining to the genital hygiene is useful. It is 
important to tell them that the genitals need to be washed daily as secretions 
accumulate under the foreskin of the penis and can cause infection if not 
cleaned regularly. They should wear dry, cotton undergarments which are washed and dried in the sun every day. 
Although you may not be consulted by boys directly, the information could be 
communicated to mothers of adolescent boys who seek your help for these concerns.
Nutritional anaemia
From our previous sections you know about Anaemia. Nutritional anaemia is common in adolescence and may be due to deficiency of Iron, Folic Acid, 
Vitamin C or Vitamin B 12 in the diet.
Adolescence and nutritional anaemia
Adolescence is a phase of rapid growth and development and the body needs 
extra iron for increased production of blood due to rapid increase in body mass. 
When this extra requirement of iron is unmet through proper diet and nutrition 
it leads to Nutritional Anaemia. It is more common in girls because of loss of blood through menstrual bleeding.
Anaemia has a serious negative impact on growth. Checking anaemia during 
this stage may help in correcting the deficits of childhood and lay down the foundations for better future health.
When girls enter reproductive age group with low iron stores there is an 
increased risk of anaemia in pregnancy- leading to low birth weight of the 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,115,"115
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasbaby and with serious implications on maternal health. This also leads to a 
deficit of iron in early childhood which is carried on till adolescence and the 
cycle continues.
If anaemia is suspected it is important to refer the adolescent girl/boy to the 
nearest health facility for further examination. In case anaemia is established 
the adolescent will be given of IFA Tablets for few weeks or months till 
haemoglobin level improves.
ASHAs role in preventing nutritional anaemia
l  Counsel the adolescents and families and ensure compliance with IFA tablets as described in section on Ante natal care during pregnancy
l  Promote measures to control malaria and other parasitic infections like hookworm infestation by taking a six monthly dose of deworming tablet.
l  Promote hygienic measures like hand washing to prevent infections like diarrhoea.
l  Mobilise girls to avail services such as WIFS* at the Anganwadi Centre.
l  Bring about early Identification and Referral
*Weekly Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation 
Programme
This is a government run programme to address nutritional anaemia in adolescents. It includes the following target groups-
l School going Adolescent girls and boys in government/government aided/municipal schools from classes 6th -12th
l Out of school adolescent girls in the age group of 10-19 years.
Under this programme, IFA supplements are distributed free on 
a fixed day of the week to the target groups. In addition to IFA 
supplements, Albendazole tablets for deworming are administered twice a year. The school based distribution is done through nodal 
teachers and AWWs will provide these supplements to the out of 
school adolescent girls."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,116,"116
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasBehavioural changes
As a part of growing up many behavioural changes are noticed 
during adolescence. This may make them more prone to 
confrontations with the parents and others. You may notice 
some adolescents being aggressive while others may be shy. Some may experience complete lack of confidence while some 
display attention seeking behaviour. Different changes are 
manifested in different individuals. You need to understand that problems in this age are related not only to the physical 
changes but also to emotional development, a search for 
identity and risk taking behaviour. These changes should not be ignored. Such problems if not recognised and managed 
timely may lead to serious consequences such as alcohol/drug abuse, juvenile delinquency etc. Family environment and peer influence are the two most important factors influencing the behaviour of the adolescence
Role of ASHA in addressing behavioural challenges
l  Build awareness and enable access to the Adolescent Friendly Health Services available in your area by letting parents and adolescents know that 
these centres have counsellors which interact with adolescents at the times of crisis or concern and help them in sorting a way out of their problems. 
l  Counsel parents to be sensitive to these changes and adopt a strategy of parental supervision with good rapport building to avoid and solve such 
issues. They need to recognise and address the signs of anxiety in their 
children.
Concepts of sexuality are laid during this phase and it is important that the adolescents have access to the correct and complete information 
related to this. This information is provided by the trained counsellors at 
the AFHS Centres based in the District Hospital/CHC. Failure to provide adolescents with appropriate and timely information represents a 
missed opportunity for reducing the incidence of unwanted pregnancy, 
sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS and their negative consequences.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasWhat are Reproductive Tract Infections
Reproductive Tract Infections (RTIs) are infections of the reproductive organs 
that are caused by various germs. Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, 
they are more common in women, because their body structure and functions 
make it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).Women are more vulnerable to these 
infections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. 
sexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk..
Why are these Diseases not Addressed? 
Women are usually shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers. There is a reluctance to seek medical 
treatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. 
The ‘decision-makers’ at home, 
like the mother-in-law, would allow a woman 
to be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems 
or infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal 
discharge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs.
Mode of Spread of RTI and STI
You need to know not all the reproductive tract infections are sexually 
transmitted but all the sexually transmitted infections are reproductive tract 
infections. Those which are sexually spread are commonly observed in cases 
when individuals indulge in casual sex usually with infected individuals or have sex with multiple partners.
In women these infections are due to:
l  Trauma during delivery
l  Use of unclean instruments during childbirth or during abortions
Reproductive Tract Infections and 
Sexually Transmitted InfectionsSection 12"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,118,"118
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl  Lack of genital hygiene particularly during menstruation
l  Sometimes also due to gastro-intestinal infections
l  Having unprotected sex with infected partners
Mothers can pass sexually transmitted infections to babies during delivery.
Signs and Symptoms of RTI 
l  Abnormal vaginal discharge, which is discoloured (bloody-yellow, greenish 
or curdy) and foul smelling – Some discharge from vagina during inter-
menstrual period, and pregnancy is normal. 
l  Ulcers or sores over the external genitals 
l  Lower abdominal pain
l  Pain or bleeding during intercourse 
l  Painful swelling in the groin 
l  Burning pain on passing urine 
l  Itching around the genitals 
Consequences of STIs
l  Infertility in men and women
l  Babies to be born too early, too small or blind; and
l  Long lasting pain in lower abdomen, or even cancer
l  Death from severe infection or AIDS
It is important that you make the women understand that these signs and symptoms could manifest very late. It is best to be aware that a woman can 
be at risk for a STI if the husband has signs of STI, has more than one sexual partner or where they could engage in casual sex in long period of travel.
Prevention of RTIs and STIs
l  Safe Deliveries in hospitals only by skilled attendant
l  Safe abortions done at registered hospitals only
l  Maintenance of genital hygiene during menstruation
l  Avoiding unsafe sex by use of condoms "
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,119,"119
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRole of ASHA in Managing and Preventing RTI and STI
l  Counsel women at risk on preventive measures.
l  Counsel women with symptoms of RTI/STI to go to the health facility for 
treatment. All 24X7 U-PHCs or higher facilities are equipped and skilled 
to provide necessary care. Tell them that they should take the course of 
medicine fully (all courses are for a week or ten days).
l  You should motivate the woman to complete the course of medicines. Not completing the course of medicines makes the bacteria resistant and can 
cause a worse infection that does not respond to drugs the next time.
l  Ensure that the husband also gets treated.
l  Counsel a woman to abstain from sexual activity during the period of 
treatment.
l  If the husband is known to indulge in extra-marital relationships, counsel the woman to avoid having unprotected sex.
HIV and AIDS
Its important for you to know the following:
l  HIV is transmitted through: 
l having unprotected sex (sex without condom);
l receiving HIV infected blood or blood products; 
l using/sharing unsterilised needles or lancets; and
l from HIV infected mother to her baby.
l  It does not spread through any other mode such as kissing and touching, holding hands, mosquito bites, sharing clothes, or 
through saliva, nose fluids, tears.
l  Who is at higher risk: Commercial Sex Workers (CSWs), Injecting 
Drug Users (IDUs), Men who have Sex with Men (MSM), migrant 
labourers, persons with multiple sexual partners, babies born to 
mothers who are HIV infected, and persons with other STIs.
l  Persons with HIV are at greater risk of getting Tuberculosis. Every 1 in 20 persons suffering from TB in India is also HIV infected.
l  HIV can be prevented by using condom during sexual intercourse (protected sex), using safe blood (when blood transfusions are 
necessary) from blood bank of government hospitals or recognised 
hospitals only, using sterilised needles/avoid sharing of needles, and by avoiding sex with multiple partners."
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,120,"120
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl  HIV testing and management facility is available in the District Hospital free 
of cost. Treatment services for AIDS are available in some district hospitals or 
in the main government hospital in the big cities.
l  You should encourage persons at high risk to go for HIV test. If women who 
are at high risk become pregnant, they must be motivated to gets tested, as 
timely treatment may prevent transmission of HIV from HIV infected mother 
to baby."

Women’s Need for Family Planning Differ 
Different women and couples have different needs for contraception. When you counsel a woman on family planning, you should keep in mind the following:
l  Marital status
l Unmarried: condoms or pills or emergency pills
l Newly married and wanting to delay the first child: condoms or pills
l  Just delivered (post-partum) or just had an abortion (post-abortal): condoms, pills, IUCD, injectables
l  Wanting to space children: condoms, pills, IUCD, injectables. (Currently not available in the public sector, but being used in the private sector)
l  Not wanting more children: Long acting (10 years) IUCD and sterilisation for the man or the woman.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,124,"124
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasRemember
In motivating individuals for adopting an appropriate family planning 
method, issues such as marital status, age, parity and overall health 
condition of the individuals should be considered first. Promotion of 
contraceptive use based only on the money as incentives offered by the government should be discouraged and individuals should be encouraged 
to choose the right method independent of the money offered as 
compensation for wage loss.The operation for the man (Vasectomy)
A vasectomy is a simple operation, with only a small puncture to block the 
tubes that carry the sperm. It takes only a few minutes to do. The operation 
does not change a man’s ability to have sex or to feel sexual pleasure. He 
still ejaculates semen but there are no sperm in the semen. The couple must be advised to use condoms or other contraceptives for 90 days following 
vasectomy.
The operation for the woman (Tubectomy)A tubal ligation is a slightly more difficult operation than a vasectomy, but it is 
still very safe. It takes about 30 minutes. A trained doctor makes a small cut in 
the woman’s abdomen, and then cuts or ties the tubes that carry the egg to the womb. The woman can have the operation within seven days of the start of the 
menstrual cycle, 24 hours after delivery, or six weeks after the delivery.
ImportantSterilisation and pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections 
and HIV infection. So for protection from STIs and HIV, a condom should be 
used during every sexual intercourse, if the woman is at risk of contracting them.

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,125,"125
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasA Woman Seeks Abortion Because
l  She does not want more children and has not used a contraceptive method 
properly or the method failed.
l  A pregnancy can endanger her life.
l  She has no partner who will help support child.
l  She got pregnant after rape.
l  The child will be born with serious birth defects.
When a woman is faced with an unwanted pregnancy, she should be able to get 
a safe abortion.
Legality: In India, abortions are legal up to 20 weeks and if done by a qualified 
practitioner. Up to 12 weeks, one doctor can do it. After 12 weeks, two doctors 
need to sign the consent form. Abortion services are free in all government 
hospitals. Women over 18 do not need anyone else to sign a consent form.
Safety: In India, only a doctor can perform an abortion, and this should be done 
under clean conditions, and with proper instruments.
Safe abortion services are often difficult to get because, there are not enough 
service providers and facilities. Those providers who do provide abortion 
services may charge a lot of money or not even be legal providers of safe 
abortion services.
Methods
All these methods can only be done by a trained, legal provider
l  Medical Abortion: This can be done only in very early pregnancies less than seven weeks or 49 days after last missed period. The drugs 
should be prescribed by and taken under the supervision of a  
legal provider.

in the health facility for a few hours. It can be done up to eight weeks of 
pregnancy.
l  Dilatation and curettage (D and C): This 
method can be done up to 12 weeks of 
pregnancy. It is associated with a higher risk 
of complications.
Post-Abortion Care
You should advise women
l  To avoid sexual intercourse or putting anything in the vagina for at least five days after the abortion.
l  Drink plenty of fluids for faster recovery.
l  That some bleeding from vagina for up to two weeks is normal, but it should be light. Next monthly period will be after 4-6 weeks.
l  That the risk of pregnancy exists as soon as intercourse is resumed regardless of monthly period. Therefore a contraceptive should be used.
Warning signs after abortion, for which you should advise 
immediate referral
l  Heavy bleeding
l  High fever
l  Severe pain in the abdomen
l  Fainting and confusion
l  Foul smelling discharge from the vagina.
Tasks for you to be involved in are
l  Counselling women who want abortion service or need more information 
to take a decision. Find out the nearest legal and safe public and private 
providers of such care.
l  Visit the mother at home on Days 3 and 7 after the abortion.

A strong preference for a male child in our society often compels married 
couples to bear more children, till they have a boy. In cases where they 
already have female children, couples may indulge in practices like pre-
natal sex determination of the foetus, followed by an abortion, in case it is a female foetus. You must build awareness in the community that prenatal 
sex determination is a criminal offence and any individual found guilty for 
disclosing or seeking information about the sex of the foetus is punishable by court under the act of PCPNDT."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasThis is the true story of how women from Dubagunta in Nellore district Andhra 
Pradesh, drove away the liquor contractors from their village. 
The main participants in the early struggle were poor rural women, predominantly 
from scheduled castes and backward classes, supported by voluntary organisations and, later, by politicians from opposition parties. It is about a miracle that ordinary 
women were able to achieve collectively. It is about a community of hard-working 
women who laboured in the fields to earn their living. The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the 
hard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), in 
exchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, they incurred debts or stole household articles like glasses, plates or even their wives’ saris. After 
drinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making 
their lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to go straight to these shops in the evening 
after returning from work. They came home late at night, completely drunk They 
would hand over some money for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his 
father to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community 
also had an alcoholic husband, when her relatives visited her house they were scared away from the village by the obscene language of her closest neighbour, 
a heavy drinker. She felt ashamed and thought that the village would be a much 
better place without arrack.
Everyday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women 
discussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached 
the village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders. They expressed their problem and asked them to get remove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the 
Sarpanch, although agreeable, were unable to do anything. The next day one 
hundred women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come into the village’ , they told the cart driver 
strongly in unison and stood in front of it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them 
offered him a rupee to do so. The driver got scared and left the village.
Then a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded 
that it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police came to the 
village and said that all those who bid at auctions had the right to sell arrack. The women stood unmoved. They said that they would go to the Collector and would 
not keep quiet if arrack was sold in their village. The arrack contractors got cold feet.  Annexure 3: Anti Arrack Movement"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,134,"134
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasThey made several plans, but nothing worked and they gave up. These events gave 
strength to the women. All this happened only because the women united and 
struggled strongly to get rid of arrack from their village.
The story of Dubagunta spread in the form of an agitation to other parts of the 
district.
In the literacy classes of other villages teachers started sensitising the community 
through puppet shows about the problems caused by arrack. They also shared the story of Dubagunta village, with the result that women in other villages did the 
same.
The women in Dubagunta started a movement in which ultimately the situation 
changed for the better.
In 1991 was the beginning of the Anti-Arrack (local liquor) Movement, which finally 
led to the prohibition of alcohol in the state on 16 January 1995.

Sub: request to organise UHND at two locations in the slum/area Dear CDHO (write the name of the concerned person): 
I am working as ASHA for the area________of________Block/District/City. My area has a 
population of________. The houses are scattered across the areas. The ANM regularly comes 
and organises UHND. However, it is organised at a place which is not accessible for all the 
pregnant women. A large number of women living on the other side of the area, are not able 
to attend the antenatal clinic, due to the distance. 
I suggest that the antenatal clinic may be conducted in two places of the area on 
different dates. I had a discussion about the same with the ANM. She informed me that 
she needs permission from you. I request you to look into this matter. As an ASHA I take the 
responsibility to bring all the pregnant women so they have their antenatal check-up.  
You are welcome to visit our area. 
Thank you. 
Yours sincerely,

1. Clean glass slides
2. Disposable Lancet
3. Spirit or Cotton swab for cleaning the finger
4. Cotton
5. Clean piece of cotton cloth
6. Lead pencil
After the patient information has been recorded on the appropriate form, the 
blood films are made as under:
l Take a clean glass slide free from grease and scratches 
l Clean the finger of the patient using a spirit swab
Take the following steps for preparation of the blood smear
i. Select the second or third finger of the left hand 
ii. The site of the puncture is the side of the ball of the finger, not too close 
to the nail bed 
iii. Allow the blood come up automatically. Do not squeeze the finger.
iv. Hold the slide by its edges 
v. The size of the blood drop is controlled better if the finger touches the 
slides from below 
"
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areas English,146,"146
Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasvi. Touch the drop of blood with a clean slide, three drops are collected for 
preparing the thick smear.
vii. Touch another new drop of blood with the edge of a clean slide for 
preparing the thin smear.
viii. Spread the drop of blood with the corner of another slide to make a 
circle or a square about 1 cm
ix. Bring the edge of the slide carrying the second drop of blood to the 
surface of the first slide, wait until the blood spreads along the whole edge
x. Holding it at an angle of about 45
o push it forward with rapid but not 
too brisk movement
xi. Write with a pencil the slide number on the thin film, Wait until the 
thick film is dry. The thin film is always used as a label to identify the patient. 
Remember 
l The blood should not be excessively stirred. Spread gently in circular or 
rectangular form with 3 to 6 movements. 
l The circular thick film should be about 1 cm (1/5 inch) in diameter.
l Allow the thick film to dry with the slide in the flat, level position protected 
from flies, dust and extensive heat.
l Label the dry thin film with a soft lead pencil by writing in the thicker 
portion of the film the blood slide number and date of collection
The lancet and cotton swab should be disposed off.

Diagnostic Test
Procedure
l Check that the test kit is within its expiry date. If not discard it. Read the 
instructions of the test kit, as there may be minor variations in the procedure 
between different kits. Place a small box, jar or bottle for trash next to the kit.
l Open a foil pouch and check that the desiccant inside it is still blue. If not, 
discard the test.
l Remove the test strip and the small glass tube or loop from the foil pouch and place them on a clean dry surface.
l Take out the buffer solution and the dropper. Place a new test tube in the multiple well plate.
l Clean a finger with the swab and let the skin dry completely in the air. Prick finger on the side with a lancet. Place lancet in trash container. Let a drop of 
blood come out on the skin.
l Touch the tip of the glass tube or the loop to the blood drop on the finger 
and let a small quantity of blood (a small drop) come up in the tube or the 
loop.
l Touch the tube or the loop to the test strip just below the arrow mark to 
place the blood there. If there is a paper, where Plasmodium falciparum is 
written, remove it and place the blood, where it was. Place tube/loop in trash 
container.
l Using the dropper, place 4 drops of buffer solution into a new test tube. After this, place the test strip containing blood in the buffer solution with 
the arrow pointing down. While waiting, a slide can be prepared.
Materials in the Rapid Diagnostic Test kit
l Spirit (alcohol) swab (one for each patient)
l Disposable Lancet (one for each patient)
l Capillary tube (one for each patient)
l Test strip (one for each patient)"

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban Areasl One multiple well plastic plate
l Test tube (one for each patient)
l Buffer solution or reagent solution
l Desiccant 
Observe after 15 minutes – if any red line does not appear in the test strip then 
the test strip is not working: discard it and use another one.
l If a single red line appears, it is not falciparum malaria. If two red lines 
appear, the test result is falciparum malaria.
l The test should be read 15 to 20 minutes after blood was taken. Earlier or later readings may lead to false results.
l Place test strip and test tube in trash container. Make sure this container is kept out of reach of children. When it is full, if in a area, bury it in the ground, 
or send it with the MPW to the U-PHC for safe disposal."

Induction Training Module for ASHAs in Urban AreasIntroduction
In order to identify and reach the marginalized and vulnerable groups in urban 
areas, ASHA will need to assess “Vulnerability” of the households/individuals 
in her area. Therefore, this tool is designed to help the ASHA in identifying 
vulnerable households/individuals. The tool is divided into five sections. The first three sections contain 17 indicators/variables which assess the extent of 
residential, social and occupational vulnerability of the household. Section IV 
collects the information on the health status and health seeking behavior of the households. Each variable is given three scores as 0,1 and 2. Zero being the 
lowest/worst case. Then, the cumulative scores are computed and based on 
the scores, the household is categorized into one of three categories i.e Most Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable and Vulnerable. The last section simple lists the 
vulnerable groups, so that if the surveyed household/individual belongs to 
any one of the category, ASHA can tick and mention the category directly for prioritization and follow up action.

Why a programme on Menstrual Hygiene?
Good menstrual hygiene is essen/g415  al for the health and dignity of girls and women. 
Discussions on menstrual hygiene are important for adolescent girls to clarify exis/g415  ng 
myths and misconcep/g415  ons around menstrua/g415  on. Improving menstrual hygiene is 
important from the point of view of personal comfort and increased mobility. It also reduces the likelihood of infec/g415  ons resul/g415  ng from poor hygiene prac/g415  ces during 
menstrua/g415  on. Providing girls with knowledge and skills on maintaining menstrual 
hygiene improves school a/g425  endance among girls, who otherwise may not a/g425  end 
school during those days or even drop out of school altogether. 
How to promote Menstrual Hygiene? 
Promo/g415  ng menstrual hygiene is achieved through: 
/circle6 Provision of health educa/g415  on to girls and women on menstrua/g415  on and 
menstrual hygiene
/circle6 Increasing community ac/g415  on to improve access to clean toilets with water, both 
at home and in schools
/circle6 Promo/g415  ng the availability and use of sanitary products
/circle6 Enabling safe disposal of sanitary products
Who can promote Menstrual Hygiene?
Menstrual Hygiene can be promoted in the community and in schools. It is best to 
start with adolescent girls; although, other women in the reproduc/g415  ve age group 
would also beneﬁ  t from the informa/g415  on and access to sanitary products. ASHA, the 
Anganwadi Workers (AWWs), and the members of women’s Self Help Groups (SHGs) can make a substan/g415  al diﬀ  erence to menstrual hygiene prac/g415  ces in the community.  
As an ASHA, you already have the advantage of being in close contact with women 
in the community. This will be helpful in providing informa/g415  on on menstrual hygiene 
and sanitary products contained in this booklet to adolescent girls and women in the community. As a member of the Village Health and Sanita/g415  on Commi/g425  ee (VHSC) 
and in working with members of the Panchayat, you can promote toilets in homes, and ensure separate toilets for girls in local schools. Members of women’s SHGs can support and assist you in encouraging menstrual hygiene and promo/g415  ng the use of 
sanitary napkins in the community. Sanitary napkins can be made locally by SHGs using a simple technology. You can encourage the groups in your village to take "

up this ac/g415  vity. Further informa/g415  on is available in the oﬃ   ces of the District Health 
Society and the District Collector.

Understanding Menstrua/g415  on and Problems during 
menstrua/g415  on
Menarche:  The onset of puberty, when the girl has her ﬁ  rst period is known as 
Menarche. Menarche may take place between 9-16 years of age. During this period, most girls observe bleeding for the ﬁ  rst /g415  me from the vagina. This bleeding becomes 
a periodic occurrence in a girl’s life with the cycle of bleeding observed in a gap of 28-40 days.  
Menstrua/g415  onWhy does menstrua/g415  on occur?
Girls have thousands of eggs in their ovaries when they are 
born. Every month, or about once in 21-40 days, one of the eggs leaves one of the ovaries, and travels through a fallopian tube. When the egg leaves the ovary, this is called ovula/g415  on. 
As the egg travels in the fallopian tube, a so/g332   spongy lining 
gets formed within the uterus. This lining is mostly made of /g415 ny blood vessels.In case an egg and sperm meet to form an 
embryo, or a baby, that begins to grow in the uterus and the lining will provide the nutri/g415  on. If the egg is not joined by a 
sperm, the lining of the uterus begins to break. The blood that is released from the broken lining, ﬂ  ows out of the vagina. 
This bleeding is the menstrual period. This whole cycle is called menstrua/g415  on.III. About Menstrua/g415  on"
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,5,"5 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAA menstrual cycle lasts from the ﬁ  rst day of one period to the ﬁ  rst day of the next. 
The typical cycle of an adult female is 28 days, although some are as short as 22 days and as long as 45 days. Periods usually last about 3-7 days, which can vary too. During a period, a woman passes about 2-4 tablespoons (30-59 millilitres) of menstrual blood.
Days 1-7
Days 8-14
Days 15-28
If the egg is not fer/g415  lised, the uterus wall  
con/g415  nues to thicken un/g415  l there is a sudden drop 
in hormone levels. The lining breaks down, and the 
next period begins.The period is considered the beginning of the menstrual cycle. 
A period normally lasts for around ﬁ  ve days, but can be 
as short as two days or as long as seven. There is usually 
around 2-6 tablespoons of blood lost during each period, depending on the heaviness of the ﬂ  ow. A period occurs 
because the uterus will shed its lining if an egg (ovum) is not 
fer/g415 lised.
One of the ovaries releases an egg and the 
uterus begins to rebuild its lining. Only 
one egg is released in each cycle. The 
egg slowly travels down the fallopian 
tube from the ovaries towards the uterus. If the egg is fer/g415  lised by a 
sperm before it arrives the uterus, the girl becomes pregnant."
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,6,"6 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAIV. What are the Problems that a Girl may 
Encounter During Menstrua/g415  on?
The diﬃ   cul/g415  es that girls may experience during menstrua/g415  on are:
1. Irregular periods2. Heavy periods3. Painful periods
Irregular Periods : For the ﬁ  rst few years of menstrua/g415  on, cycles are o/g332  en irregular. 
They may be shorter (3 weeks) or longer (6 weeks). A young girl may even have only three or four periods a year. A girl’s cycles will usually become regular within two to three years a/g332  er menarche. 
Heavy periods: A heavy period is one which lasts longer than eight days, saturates 
the napkin within an hour or includes large clots of blood in the menstrual ﬂ  ow. 
This is common in adolescents because of slight imbalance in chemical hormones secreted by the body. However, if this happens regularly, it leaves the girl feeling exhausted; which means that the body is losing more blood than it is producing. The girl should then consult a doctor immediately.
Painful period:  Slight pain during periods is quite normal. This is due to the secre/g415  ons 
of a chemical called prostaglandins in larger quan/g415  ty than normal. This leads to 
nausea, headaches, diarrhoea and severe cramps. Usually, this lasts only for a day or two. To get relief from these symptoms, a girl should try the following methods:
/circle6 Fill a plas/g415  c bo/g425  le with hot water, wrap it in a towel and place it on the 
abdomen,
/circle6 Massage the abdomen 
/circle6 Local remedies such as ginger tea can be taken
Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS):  This refers to a combina/g415  on of physical and 
emo/g415  onal symptoms experienced by all women during the menstrual cycle, usually 
just before bleeding begins. These symptoms include:
a.  Temporary weight gain and 
a feeling of heaviness due to accumula/g415  on of water 
in the body

/circle6 Menstrua/g415  on is part of every woman’s life and there should be no shame or 
embarrassment around this.
/circle6 There is no impurity or pollu/g415  on associated with menstrua/g415  on.
/circle6 Menstrua/g415  on should not be seen as an obstacle to daily ac/g415  vi/g415 es
/circle6 Prac/g415  ces such as seclusion or staying away from school must be discouraged. 
V. Menstrual Hygiene, Use and Disposal of 
Sanitary Napkins 
What is commonly used by girls and women to absorb 
menstrual blood?
Girls and women use diﬀ  erent ways to absorb menstrual blood. One of the most 
common methods used is a cloth which is folded and placed within the underwear, or passes over the private parts by means of a string /g415  ed around the waist. This cloth 
is washed and reused most of the /g415  me. Key Messages 
c.  Painful or heavy feeling in the breasts d.  Feelings of irritability 
These symptoms begin ﬁ  ve to seven days before the period starts and disappear 
before the bleeding begins. This can be managed with remedies for pain described above and ea/g415  ng a diet that is low in salt, and includes foods like leafy green 
vegetable and raw fruits and vegetables, which are low in sugar and high in ﬁ  bre.
"
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,8,"8 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAO/g332 en the cloth is not washed properly, without soap and using very li/g425  le water. Many 
girls are embarrassed about drying the cloth under the sun (where it can be seen by others). Therefore, the cloth stays damp and this can give rise to skin infec/g415  ons. 
What is a sanitary napkin?
A sanitary napkin is a pad that is worn during menstrua/g415  on to absorb the ﬂ  ow 
of blood. The sanitary napkin is to be used by the girl during her periods (when the blood is ﬂ  owing) so that it can help her carry out normal work without any 
discomfort. Sanitary napkins are disposable and should be discarded a/g332  er being used 
once. You can obtain a stock of sanitary napkins and store it for distribu/g415  on to girls. 
The sanitary napkin has three layers: 
/circle6 The lowest layer that lies on the underwear. 
/circle6 The middle layer which soaks the blood quickly and prevents leakage.
/circle6 A surface layer that is close to the skin. It is made of perforated material that 
keeps the skin dry and acts as a barrier between the skin and the absorbent panel.
There are two types of napkins: 
/circle6 Sanitary napkin with an adhesive (s/g415  cky) strip: This napkin has a strip of paper 
on its lowest layer which can be peeled oﬀ  , and the pad can then be stuck to the 
underwear. 
/circle6 Non adhesive sanitary napkin used with or without an underwear: These napkin 
have a special elas/g415  c belt or a waist girdle with loops. The pad has an external 
bag-like covering with long ﬂ  aps that can slide into the loops. 
What are the advantages of sanitary napkins?
/circle6 Disposable sanitary napkins are more convenient and easier to use than 
reusable cloth.
/circle6 Since the blood gets absorbed into the middle layer, there is a feeling of dryness. 
/circle6 When changed o/g332  en, they can prevent infec/g415  on.
/circle6 They can be used by women of all age groups.
/circle6 They allow girls more mobility and thus can allow them to take part in 
school ac/g415  vi/g415 es. 
"
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,9,"9 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAWhat should you do if sanitary napkins are not available 
immediately? 
Although a sanitary napkin is a convenient and safe method for maintaining menstrual 
hygiene, it is possible that one may not be able to get the sanitary napkin in /g415  me. In 
such circumstances, a cloth pad can be used as a subs/g415  tute. Many women use a cloth 
pad wrapped in co/g425  on or folded cloth, which is held by a string between the legs.
Points to remember when using a cloth pad: 
1. Use clean co/g425  on cloth for making the cloth pads. Pads made of synthe/g415  c ﬁ bre 
will not absorb the menstrual ﬂ  uid and cause irrita/g415  on and itching.
2. The cloth should be changed 3-4 /g415  mes during the day, in case of a heavy 
menstrual ﬂ  ow.
3. The used cloth should be washed separately with hot water and soap and dried 
in the sun. 
4. If the cloth has to be used again, it must be stored in a dry place. 
Things to remember about menstrual hygiene
/circle6 Once wet, the napkin should be changed immediately. If not it can cause 
irrita/g415  on on the inside of the thighs and can lead to infec/g415  ons.
/circle6 Sanitary napkins should be kept in a clean and dry place.
/circle6 It is essen/g415  al to wash the body and private parts daily.
/circle6 During menstrua/g415  on, the outer genitals should be washed from /g415  me-to-/g415  me 
to remove any blood that is le/g332  . Girls should wash their hands every /g415  me they 
change the napkin.
/circle6 If the underwear is soiled, it must be changed. Otherwise this makes bacteria to 
grow and cause infec/g415  on.
/circle6 If sanitary napkins are not available, a clean cloth pad should be used.
"
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,10,"10 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAHow to dispose of sanitary napkins?
Safe disposal of sanitary napkins is important. Where there are facili/g415  es for regular 
garbage removal, girls should be encouraged to wrap the used napkin in an old newspaper and throw them into dustbins which are emp/g415  ed daily. If garbage is not 
collected daily, the napkins should be disposed of by burying them in a deep pit or by burning them. Some schools have machines in which a large quan/g415  ty of napkins 
can be burnt. These are called incinerators. However, not all schools have these. Girls should be cau/g415  oned against throwing away used napkins under bushes or out 
in the open. Sanitary napkins, if collected in one place for a long /g415  me, begin to emit 
bad odour, and become a site where bacteria can mul/g415  ply. They can also block drains 
and cause problems with sanita/g415  on. 
Planning for menstrual periods
Once menarche sets in, girls should be encouraged to plan for their menstrual 
periods. This includes keeping track of their menstrual cycles so that they are prepared for the /g415  me when the bleeding starts. As periods may be irregular in the 
early years, girls should be encouraged to be alert for the bleeding. If they are school going girls or plan to be out of home for a long while, they should carry a sanitary napkin with them. 
VI. Key Ac/g415  vi/g415 es to Promote 
Menstrual Hygiene
(i) Organising monthly mee/g415  ngs on a ﬁ  xed day for adolescent 
girls:  One of your responsibili/g415  es is to organise monthly 
mee/g415  ngs on a ﬁ  xed day at the Anganwadi Centre or Panchayat 
Bhavan for adolescent girls in the target age group of 10-19 years. The day will be ﬁ  xed by the state government and 
will be observed throughout the state. The purpose of this "
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,11,"11 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAmee/g415  ng is to provide health educa/g415  on to girls on issues of menstrua/g415  on and 
menstrual hygiene. You should use the ﬂ  ip book provided to you to conduct 
this session. The second purpose of this mee/g415  ng is to make sanitary napkins 
available to the girls. This can be done through the support of the Anganwadi worker and other members of the women self help groups in the village. The mee/g415  ng should be held in collabora/g415  on with the Kishori Samooh or an 
Adolescent Resource Centre under the SABLA scheme, where it exists. For this, you will be paid an incen/g415  ve of Rs. 50. These mee/g415  ngs will also serve 
as venues where informa/g415  on on adolescent-related health can be 
communicated. 
(ii) Conduc/g415  ng home visits for girls who do not regularly a/g425  end monthly 
mee/g415  ngs: Monthly mee/g415  ngs should be complemented by household 
visits to promote menstrual hygiene among girls and other inﬂ  uencers in 
the family, who are unable to a/g425  end the monthly mee/g415  ngs. This would 
mo/g415 vate a/g425  endance for future mee/g415  ngs. 
(iii) Using the venue of Village Health and Nutri/g415  on 
Day and the Village Health and Sanita/g415  on 
Commi/g425  ee mee/g415  ngs to discuss menstrual 
hygiene: Apart from girls, other women in the 
reproduc/g415  ve age group also need informa/g415  on 
on menstrual hygiene. You should use the opportunity to provide this informa/g415  on to women 
when they a/g425  end the VHND at the Anganwadi 
centre. The VHSC is also responsible for providing toilets in households and in schools. You should support this process by discussing the importance of toilets for girls in schools as an important component of menstrual hygiene. 
(iv) Enabling regular availability of sanitary napkins to girls in the age 
group of 10-19 years: You can obtain supplies of sanitary napkins from 
the ANM and supply them to girls during the monthly mee/g415  ng. Girls 
who are unable to a/g425  end these mee/g415  ngs should be reached through 
home visits to ensure supply. Under the scheme, all rural adolescents will be supplied sanitary napkins at a reasonable price which would be ﬁ xed by the government. 
(v) Maintaining an inventory of the stock and keeping 
accounts: You will need to es/g415  mate the number of 
packs required for your village. Thus, you will require a list of girls in the age group of 10-19 years. In order to obtain the list, you can elicit support from the AWW and the members of the SHG. The stock of sanitary napkins can be obtained from the ANM. The ANM will also provide you with a one-/g415  me-imprest fund of 
Rs.300, which she will take from the un/g415  ed funds pool 
"
Menstrual Hygiene Reading Material For ASHA,12,"12 Menstrual Hygiene: Reading Material for ASHAof the sub centre. You will also get a pack of sanitary napkin for your own use. 
You will follow these steps during purchase and sale of sanitary napkins: 
/circle6 Use the imprest fund of Rs. 300 to purchase sanitary napkins from the ANM.
/circle6 Be responsible for the transporta/g415  on and storage of napkins to 
the village. 
/circle6 Supply the napkins to adolescent girls at a reasonable price.
/circle6 Retain an incen/g415  ve of Re. 1 for every packet sold/distributed. 
/circle6 Maintain a monthly record of sanitary napkin packs sold to the girls and 
keep account of the money recovered. The registers and accounts should be co-signed by a designated female member of the VHSC.
